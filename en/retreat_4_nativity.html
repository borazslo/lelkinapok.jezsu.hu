    <title>RETREAT #4 — THE NATIVITY</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1 id="title_5-1"><span class="number">1.</span>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <div>
        <p>We organized this retreat in 2018 in the Fényi Gyula Jesuit High School with 700 students. The description below can be used by group leaders as is.</p>
        <p>Jesus the Son of God was not born in an elegant palace. He was born in a dirty, smelly, and probably cold stable. He is not avoiding us today. He willingly comes to our hearts, even if our hearts are not always shiny and clean, even when we are clumsy, lazy and sinful. We are going to build a nativity scene together. It will be like our hearts: not very orderly, not perfect, but there are colours, warmth, ideas and love in it. Let us build our stable in which we can receive Jesus. Maybe it will bring more warmth, purity and love to our own hearts too.</p>

        </h2>
        <div>
            <p>We start with singing. E.g.: O Come O Come Emmanuel. Then we introduce the theme of the retreat. The following meditation may be helpful.</p>
            <otlet>
				<p>It may be more interesting if the readers of Bible passages read from various corners and in the gallery of the church or hall. Prophecies sound really impressive from above. A good sound system is important.</p> 
                <p>We can read these prophetic scripture passages at the beginning or at the end of the retreat, with or without explanations, one after the other, maybe with Advent hymn verses sung between readings.</p> </otlet>

            <div class="card">
                <h3 id="title_5-2-2-1">THOUGHTS ABOUT WAITING FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS</h3>
                <p>Let us fly back in time, several hundred years before Jesus. These were hard times for the Jews of the Old Testament. Let us imagine what it was like.</p>
                <p>…Our country is under occupation, and everything is in ruins in the country where we used to live. It is worse than the coronavirus pandemic or the world war, because we were forced to leave our homes. Families were torn apart. We can’t be together with our loved ones. We had to move to another country where we do not speak the language. We do not know anybody here. They eat strange food. We do not understand them. There is no hope that we will ever see our friends and family again. We do not want to have children, what is the point? Who will raise them? Our culture and our language and everything that is ours will die with us.</p>
                <p>This was going on and on for several centuries. Generation after generation lived like that. What were they expecting from God in Israel and Judah? And what did God say to them at that time? What was he telling them through his prophets again and again?</p>
                <p>Isaiah 7:14 “Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Look, the young woman is with child and shall bear a son, and shall name him Immanuel.”</p>
                <p>“A young woman is with child and shall bear a son”. It is the hope of resurrection, life going on: a boy child. Hope is a pleasant, believable picture about the future. For example when I have a hard time studying, I can only hope that if I do well tomorrow at the exam, it will feel really good, and my parents will praise me, and they will be happy. The true hope is that they will be happy about me no matter what. Even if I don’t do well on the exam.</p>
                <p>God is telling us even more: Isaiah 11:1-4a “A shoot shall come out from the stump of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots. The spirit of the Lord shall rest on him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord. His delight shall be in the fear of the Lord. He shall not judge by what his eyes see, or decide by what his ears hear; but with righteousness he shall judge the poor and decide with equity for the meek of the earth.”</p>
                <p>“A shoot shall come out from the stump of Jesse” - we are talking about a stump of a felled tree, probably covered with moss already, but it shoots a new branch that grows into a large tree again. We may think we do not know too much, and that we will never be good enough at a subject for example. But when we let God enter into our life we can discover absolutely amazing qualities in ourselves where we earlier had thought there was nothing.</p>
                <p>While we are waiting for God to enter into our life He is sending us more messages. Isaiah 40:3-5 “A voice cries out: ‘In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low; the uneven ground shall become level, and the rough places a plain. Then the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all people shall see it together, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.’”</p>
				<p>“Prepare the way of the Lord!” - So we are not supposed to waste time doing nothing or feeling desperate, or wallowing in self-pity. The Lord is coming. It is great news, and it is already happening. May we believe that He is good, that he is Goodness Himself. He wants to give the best for us. What will it be like? The prophet tells us:</p>
                <p>Isaiah 42:1-4: “Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the nations. He will not cry or lift up his voice, or make it heard in the street; a bruised reed he will not break, and a dimly burning wick he will not quench; he will faithfully bring forth justice. He will not grow faint or be crushed until he has established justice in the earth; and the coastlands wait for his teaching.”</p>
                <p>“He will not cry or lift up his voice” - he is gentle, and is not coming as some people expected Him to, to put everything in order and destroy the enemy by lightning and a flaming sword. He often comes very differently than how we expect Him to. A real surprise! He comes tenderly, not with a big noise. When we stumble, he raises us up, when our little light is growing faint, He helps us shine.</p>
                <p>What is He bringing for us? Isaiah 51:4: “A teaching will go out from me, and my justice for a light to the peoples. I will bring near my deliverance swiftly.” Sometimes we study hard, but we can’t do well in the exam, and get a bad grade. Then we become frustrated, angry, we are afraid of what our parents will say, that we are not good enough. This is where God will bring His justice and deliver us from every bad feeling. We will receive more than we deserve.</p>
                <p>Imagine what the Jews of the Old Testament felt when they heard these prophecies. What do we feel?</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3 id="title_5-3-2-2">THE HOLY NIGHT BY SELMA LAGERLÖF — EXCERPT</h3>
                <p>It was Christmas Day and all the folks had driven to church except grandmother and I. I believe
				we were all alone in the house. We had not been permitted to go along, because one of us was too
				old and the other was too young. And we were sad, both of us, because we had not been taken to
				early mass to hear the singing and to see the Christmas candles.</p>
				<p>But as we sat there in our loneliness, grandmother began to tell a story.</p>
				<p>There was a man who went out in the dark night to borrow live coals to kindle a fire. He went from
				hut to hut and knocked. „Dear friends, help me!” said he. „My wife has just given birth to a child,
				and I must make a fire to warm her and the little one.”</p>
				<p>But it was way in the night, and all the people were asleep. No one replied.</p>
				<p>The man walked and walked. At last, he saw the gleam of a fire a long way off. Then he went in that
				direction and saw that the fire was burning in the open. A lot of sheep were sleeping around the
				fire, and an old shepherd sat and watched over the flock.</p>
				<p>When the man who wanted to borrow fire came up to the sheep, he saw that three big dogs lay
				asleep at the shepherd’s feet. All three awoke when the man approached and opened their great
				jaws, as though they wanted to bark; but not a sound was heard. The man noticed that the hair
				on their backs stood up and that their sharp, white teeth glistened in the firelight. They dashed
				toward him.</p>
				<p>He felt that one of them bit at his leg, and one at his hand, and that one clung to his throat. But their
				jaws and teeth wouldn’t obey them, and the man didn’t suffer the least harm.</p>
				<p>Now the man wished to go farther, to get what he needed. But the sheep lay back to back and
				so close to one another that he couldn’t pass them. Then the man stepped upon their backs and
				walked over them and up to the fire. And not one of the animals awoke or moved.</p>
				<p>When the man had almost reached the fire, the shepherd looked up. He was a surly old man, who
				was unfriendly and harsh toward human beings. And when he saw the strange man coming, he
				seized the long, spiked staff, which he always held in his hand when he tended his flock, and threw
				it at him. The staff came right toward the man, but, before it reached him, it turned off to one side
				and whizzed past him, far out in the meadow.</p>
				<p>Now the man came up to the shepherd and said to him: „Good man, help me, and lend me a little
				fire! My wife has just given birth to a child, and I must make a fire to warm her and the little one.”</p>
				<p>The shepherd would rather have said no, but when he pondered that the dogs couldn’t hurt the
				man, and the sheep had not run from him and that the staff had not wished to strike him, he was
				a little afraid, and dared not deny the man that which he asked.</p>
				<p>„Take as much as you need!” he said to the man.</p>
				<p>But then the fire was nearly burnt out. There were no logs or branches left, only a big heap of live
				coals, and the stranger had neither spade nor shovel wherein he could carry the red-hot coals.</p>
				<p>When the shepherd saw this, he said again: „Take as much as you need!” And he was glad that the
				man wouldn’t be able to take away any coals.</p>
				<p>But the man stopped and picked coals from the ashes with his bare hands, and laid them in his
				mantle. And he didn’t burn his hands when he touched them, nor did the coals scorch his mantle;
				but he carried them away as if they had been nuts or apples.</p>
				<p>And when the shepherd, who was such a cruel and hardhearted man, saw all this, he began to wonder to himself. What kind of a night is this, when the dogs do not bite, the sheep are not scared, the
				staff does not kill, or the fire does not scorch? He called the stranger back and said to him: „What
				kind of a night is this? And how does it happen that all things show you compassion?”</p>
				<p>Then said the man: „I cannot tell you if you yourself do not see it.” And he wished to go his way,
				that he might soon make a fire and warm his wife and child.</p>
				<p>But the shepherd did not wish to lose sight of the man before he had found out what all this might
				portend. He got up and followed the man till they came to the place where he lived.</p>
				<p>Then the shepherd saw the man didn’t have so much as a hut to dwell in, but that his wife and babe
				were lying in a mountain grotto, where there was nothing except the cold and naked stone walls.</p>
				<p>But the shepherd thought that perhaps the poor innocent child might freeze to death there in the
				grotto; and, although he was a hard man, he was touched, and thought he would like to help it.
				And he loosened the knapsack from his shoulder, took from it a soft white sheepskin, gave it to the
				strange man, and said that he should let the child sleep on it.</p>
				<p>But just as soon as he showed that he, too, could be merciful, his eyes were opened, and he saw
				what he had not been able to see before, and heard what he could not have heard before.</p>
				<p>He saw that all around him stood a ring of little silver-winged angels, and each held a stringed
				instrument, and all sang in loud tones that tonight the Saviour was born who should redeem the
				world from its sins.</p>
				<p>Then he understood how all things were so happy that night that they didn’t want to do anything
				wrong.</p>
				<p>And it was not only around the shepherd that there were angels, but he saw them everywhere. They
				sat inside the grotto, they sat outside on the mountain, and they flew under the heavens. They
				came marching in great companies, and, as they passed, they paused and cast a glance at the child.</p>
				<p>There was such jubilation and such gladness and songs and play! And all this he saw in the dark
				night whereas before he could not have made out anything. He was so happy because his eyes had
				been opened that he fell upon his knees and thanked God.</p>
				<p>What that shepherd saw, we might also see, for the angels fly down from heaven every Christmas
				Eve, if we could only see them.</p>
				<p>You must remember this, for it is as true, as true as that I see you and you see me. It is not revealed
				by the light of lamps or candles, and it does not depend upon sun and moon, but that which is
				needful is that we have such eyes as can see God’s glory

		<h2 id="title_5-3-4"><span class="number">3.4.</span>VARIATIONS FOR PROCESSING THE STORY</h2>
		<div>
			<p>The main goal is to get closer to the story. The Scripture does not give a very detailed description of the people in the story. We do not know what they felt or thought. If we try to imagine what else may have happened to these people that day: they had dinner, they made preparations before their journey, somebody was in a hurry and his ankle buckled, the events in the Bible story may become more real for us. We can also try to imagine ourselves in their places. What would we have done in their place? What would have been our reaction?</p>
			<p>Read all the variations and choose the one you feel closest to yourself. When the group finishes one, always have a discussion about it. When there is nothing more to say, choose another variation to process the story. You do not have to do all of them, just the ones you feel may help the group.</p>
			
                <h3 id="title_5-3-4-1">VARIATION 1 — DRAMATIZATION OF THE STORY</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>After reading the story and the Scripture, divide the group into even smaller groups who will prepare to present one scene. Feel free to make your own version, but make sure there is a fire in each vignette. You can use a red scarf that represents the fire. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You may want to arrange the furniture in the room to resemble a theatre.</li>
                        <li>Start every scene with one minute complete silence after the actors take their positions in the scene. It will help everyone get in the mood.</li>
                        <li>The children can present the story with their own words, and they can include new elements. They can also do a play with only movements, (or just sound effects) while somebody is reading the text.</li>
                        <li>After the performance the group leader can go up to one of the actors and do a mini-interview. For example if there was a wolf in the story, they can be asked like this: <quote>Hello, Mr. Wolf. I can see that you are very angry. What happened? …And why did you not bite him?</quote>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <tanacs><p>As you are doing the interview, go up to the person, squat down to his or her level, and talk so that everyone can hear you very well.</p>  </tanacs>
                    <p>After all the scenes were presented, we started a discussion about the fire. What does it represent? What is the light we all are looking for? What is Joseph looking for?</p>
                </div>
                <h3 id="title_5-3-4-2">VARIATION 2 — NATIVITY TABLEAU</h3>
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ask the group to listen to the story quietly. Read the Scripture passage slowly. You may want to include some extras like a description of the time of day, the lights, sounds, smells etc</li>
                        <li>Mark the three most important locations in the story: the stable, the city, the field with the flock of sheep.</li>
                        <li>The participants quietly, without talking to each other, walk to the location/group (!) where they feel the most at home. (In the stable, where the heart of the story happens. In the city where there is distance and lack of understanding. In the field where there is surprise and joy.)</li>
                        <li>After everyone has found their group, they divide the roles. They can be anything or anyone they want (they may want to be a creature that is not mentioned in the Scripture passage, and that is all right.) Make sure the key roles are being represented: Jesus, Mary, Joseph, shepherd, angel.</li>
                        <li>Then the group leader walks around and makes a short interview with every actor: <quote> Good evening, Mr. Shepherd. What can I call you, sir? Aren’t you a bit cold, Mr XY? What was your day like?</quote> - Everybody listens to the interviews.</li>
                        <li>Now the actors come alive and do what they are supposed to do. (There can be several parallel scenes) </li>
                        <li>The group leader claps his hands after 2-3 minutes and everybody returns to their seats.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Sit in a circle and discuss the experience. Talk about the pain, joy, difficulties and beauty of birth. Why do you think God decided to take upon Himself the miracle of incarnation, to become human, while he clearly did not need to do so.</p>

                    <p>Who are we: the shepherd and Joseph. (Draw the silhouettes of the two figures on a sheet of brown wrapping paper at the beginning of this activity.)</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All participants together or divided into two groups start discussing what the two persons in the story are like: What does the shepherd look like? What does he feel? What are his motivations? What is he doing? What kind of a person is he?</li>
                        <li>Do the same about Joseph. Write them down on the wrapping paper with different colours.</li>
                        <li>In a guided silent meditation think about the following: What are these people like in my own Nativity scene? Are they simpler, more human? If I am the shepherd, what are my emotions? If I was Joseph, what would I feel?

						<h4>THE BEST CHRISTMAS PRESENT — Based on the original text by Ferenc Patch SJ</h4>
						
						<p>What would you like for Christmas? Lean back and close your eyes. Imagine the Christmas tree all
						shiny and beautiful, with dozens of wrapped Christmas presents under it. Go to the tree and pick
						up your present. The box contains exactly what you really wanted, and you got it from the very
						person whom you wanted to get it from.</p>
						<p>We played this game with a group of best friends. We all know and like each other quite well, and
						we are not ashamed to openly share our thoughts and feelings when we are together.</p>
						<p>Almost all the women wanted their husbands to listen to them quietly, and spend more time
						together. Most of the men first started talking about cool gadgets and sports equipment, but then
						they decided on a week of rest, some freedom from the daily routine and escaping from the world
						of work performance and responsibilities. So even the men wanted something that they were not
						able to accomplish alone, a need that their spouse could notice and maybe allow them to have.</p>
						<p>A couple with adult children shared what happened to them last Christmas. That was their first
						Christmas when none of their children could come to visit, so there were just the two of them.
						Somehow they were not motivated to do the usual preparations, the tree was not very nicely decorated, the room was not very orderly, and it was already Christmas Eve. Then they consciously
						made a decision together to not get upset about it. They sat down in their armchairs and played a
						game. The rule was to remember something the other person made them happy in the past year.
						They both were quite surprised how many things they remembered. There were little things they
						never thought the other would notice, and things they did not even mean to make the other happy.
						After their game they found some leftovers to heat up and had dinner in such peace. It was the best
						Christmas Eve.</p>
						<p>And You? What do you want for Christmas?</p>

                    <p> Guided meditation: let everybody imagine the most beautiful Christmas when everyone gets what they most long for. Use your own words or read the following slowly:</p>
                    <tanacs><p>Use a stopwatch to measure 30 and 60 seconds between the sentences. Do not be afraid of silence.</p> </tanacs>

                        <li>Sit comfortably, like during storytime, so that we can daydream a little.</li>
                        <li>Close your eyes. Imagine the most beautiful Christmas celebration possible. You are standing under a gigantic Christmas tree. There are all kinds of ornaments, candles, sparklers and lights on the tree. The ornaments are glittering. There is a small Nativity scene under the tree: Joseph is helping, Mary is resting, the baby Jesus is looking happy. There are many presents with colorful ribbons tied around them. (Wait 30 seconds)</li>
                        <li>→ Go to the tree, bow down and pick up your present. Shake the box gently. What can it be? Very carefully untie the ribbon and unwrap your present. Open the box.</li>
                        <li>It is the thing you wanted the most, and you got it from the person you wanted to get it from the most. (Leave enough time to imagine it, maybe 60 seconds).</li>
                        <li>Hug this present, hold it to your heart. Then put it back in the box very gently . Close the box, make sure your present is safe. It will be waiting for you there. Now come back to the present and open your eyes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong> Everybody shares</strong> what was in their box. In a second round the children can talk about what touched them the most in what the others shared. Would you like to change your present for that? Did you understand something?</p>
                    <tanacs><p>If somebody does not want to share, it is allowed to pass. But ask them again, maybe they just need a bit of encouragement.</p> </tanacs>

                    <p>The poor, wicked shepherd in the story saw the world through his dark glasses for a very long time. When he saw the miracles around him, he became curious, and this is how eventually he ended up in front of the child Jesus. And only then he realized that he can look upon the world differently: he began to see the angels, the celebration, the happiness.</p>
                    <p><strong>Making eye-glasses.</strong> We cut out a pair of cardboard spectacle frames, the bigger the better. The “lenses” can be made of coloured foil or nothing. It is important that we can see through them.</p>
                    <p><strong> The group leader tries on the spectacles.</strong> These are the spectacles of Jesus. When you look through them, you can see the way He sees us. His loving attention also forms us.</p>

I can see some tired students who are waiting for the holidays. They seem to have had enough of studying. They are probably waiting for the end of this day too. I can see some anger and dissent too... </quote>

                            Now put on the spectacles. <quote>I am trying to imagine what Jesus would notice if He was standing in the room. He can see the world differently: he does not only notice what is bad and gray and dirty, but sees the beauty as well. What would Jesus see if he was looking at us now? What are the good and beautiful things He would notice in us? Come and look through the spectacles of Jesus. Imagine the same room and the same people with the eyes of Jesus.</quote>

                            <quote> What a wonderful gift it is that we can see God in Jesus, a baby, who is looking upon the world with genuine enthusiasm and love. God is not watching us from some faraway place above as a sternly judging policeman who wants to control us. God rather decided to become human: a marveling, loving person who has longings just like us. A person whom we can touch and who can touch us.

            <div>
                <p>This creative activity summarizes the whole retreat. It is a creation that the whole school puts
				together, also it is the creations of the small groups, something that your group made and contributed to the whole community, and also it is becoming a personal reflection at the same time.
				Every group makes their parts or persons for the Nativity. The members of the Holy Family will be
				the size of a shoebox, so the whole thing will occupy a couple of square metres. The chart below
				shows the possible persons and parts to build. We will build the Nativity in the Church.</p>
                <p>The birth of Christ has made the whole world and our lives in it more beautiful. We would like to
				point to and emphasize this beauty so that everyone can see it. This is why we build a Nativity,
				and everyone has a place around it. First the light was shining on only the Holy Family then it was
				extended to the shepherds, then to the Magi, and eventually the light will shine on everybody in
				the whole world. </p>
                <p>In the time of Saint Francis of Assissi the Holy Land was very dangerous, and not many people
				could afford to travel that far. However, It was very important for Saint Francis, (and later for Saint
				Ignatius of Loyola too), to see and touch the holy places where the nativity and the other events
				of the life of Jesus took place. This was the reason why Saint Francis built the first Nativity scene:
				if we are not able to travel there, the Holy family will come to us. The Incarnation is like that too:
				God is coming to stay among us.</p>
                <p><strong>Writing prayers:</strong> Every object has a part where the groups can write something. The flames of
				the fire, the branches of the tree, the floorboards of the stable etc. These inscriptions can be either
				a prayer, a request, thanksgiving related to Christmas, an attribute of the light coming to shine
				upon us, attributes of Joseph, Mary, an important thing that is necessary in order to have a good
				Christmas, or a beautiful Christmas memory.</p>
                <p><strong> Parts of the Nativity</strong></p>
                <p>The teachers who do not lead any groups today help lay the foundations of the Nativity scene in
				the church. They carry tables and screens (we are to hang the heaven and the earth from those)
				and some sheets or curtains, etc.</p>
                <tanacs><p>It is not important to have absolutely everything. Also, we can have two, three or even more elements. We can use whatever we have</p> 
                <p>Eggboxes, paper, lollipop sticks and other Nativity craft ideas. (

                <p>Our creations will be quite diverse. There will be smaller or bigger objects, some more colorful
				while others are paler, there are tidy-looking ones and wrinkled ones. This will be the beauty of it.
				We are also very diverse, and everybody comes according to their own means in that originally
				gray, dirty and smelly stable to stand before the Savior. Our common, most important goal is to
				go and stand before Him, that is what we want to express with our creations.</p>

        <h1 id="title_5-4"><span class="number">4.</span>HOLY MASS</h1>
        <div>
            <p>Build the Nativity by all means, even if there is no time for Holy Mass. Sing songs and we can say a beautiful blessing at the end.</p>
            <p>The group leaders arrive at the church with their groups at least 15 minutes before the Mass. They bring the things they made. Teachers help the groups put their objects in the assigned places and assemble the Nativity. </p>
			<p>Sing Advent songs while waiting.</p>
            <p>Traditional Holy Mass follows. Beautiful Gregorian chants or the organ can add a lot to the children’s enjoyment of the Mass, especially if they can join in.</p>
            <p>At the end the priest may bless the Nativity scene. (See the Book of Blessings) The Nativity scene will be presented throughout the winter holidays to bring the joy of Christs’s birth to the faithful.</p>
            <p> Recommended songs for worship or holy mass:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>O Come O Come Emmanuel
				<li>O Holy Night</li>
				<li>Within the darkest night (Taize)</li>
				<li>Magnificat (Taize)</li>
				<li>Wait for the Lord (Taize)</li>
				<li>Jesus name above all names (Naida Hearn)</li>
