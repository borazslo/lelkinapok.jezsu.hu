    <title>RETREAT #5 — BECOMING CLEAN</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1 id="title_6-1"><span class="number">1.</span>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <div>
        <p>We organized this retreat in the Lent of 2018 in Fényi Gyula Jesuit High School with 600 students. The description can be used by group leaders as is.</p>
        <p>We can often and quite easily lose the purity of our souls. Conscious sins, unconscious errors, and unintended mistakes make us dirty. We can try in vain, our own resources are not enough to have a new beginning; we are not able to cleanse ourselves. The good news, the Gospel is that God unconditionally forgives us and cleanses us again and again, every time when we ask Him with just one word.</p>

            <p><strong>Greetings,</strong> announcing the program of the day.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction story:</strong> Some students who can read well will read the story, also we may want to include some of the teachers too. We can play the sound of a train in the background.</p>
            <div class="card">
                „The train was slowly approaching the station. All the passengers seemed happily excited to finally
				arrive home. I noticed a young man who was anxiously looking out the window. We started talking and 
				he told me his sad story. He had left home in a surge of rebelliousness against his parents
				when he was much younger. He could not bear the atmosphere of their home. With his new
				friends he tried everything his parents wanted to protect him from. Soon he found himself in jail
				where he truly regretted his past mistakes. He was released just that morning when we met. He
				had nowhere else to go, so he wrote to his parents. He asked them to forgive him and allow him
				to return home. He also wrote that he did understand if they were not able to forgive him. He was
				coming in the afternoon train. He asked his parents to give him a sign, tie a white handkerchief
				on the walnut tree in the garden, so that he can see from the train if they were ready to accept him,
				otherwise he would not even get off the train. As we were approaching the village the young man
				seemed to be so overwhelmed with anxiety that he was not able to look out the window. He asked
				me to look if there was the white handkerchief of forgiveness on the tree or not. Soon I got sight 
				of the walnut tree. Its branches were full of white handkerchiefs, and, moreover, large white bed
				sheets were hanging from it to stop the boy continuing his journey.”

            <p><strong>Introductory words:</strong> A short introduction of the theme. Do not preach! The speaker can share his personal experiences with his own words.</p>
			
            <p><quote>Today we are trying to look upon our merciful, loving God. It will help us understand sin better. It
				is so liberating to understand that the whole life of Jesus is a challenge, that even the biggest sinner can have a new start in life. Let us think about the story of the Prodigal son, or the lost sheep
				and the lost drachma. They were found, they were accepted, they found their places again. But
				we can also remember the miracles of Jesus. They show that there is healing and recovery from
				all human weaknesses. He healed the leper, the paralytic, the blind, to show us, by the power of
				God, that the most impossible person will be able to stand up and reach the light.</quote></p>
            <p>We often reject the sinner. We quite often and quite easily forsake one another… for example we
				say things like, ‘well this person will not amount to anything’. But Jesus teaches us that God will
				never cease to be our Father. When we turn our backs on Him, He still keeps loving us and waits
				patiently for us to repent and come back to Him. There is no sin He can’t wash away, from which
				we can’t return to Him. Whatever may happen, the important thing is that you return to Jesus with
				full confidence, and start following him.</p>

                After the introduction the group leaders give one piece of clean, white cloth to every group 
				member (at this point do not explain what it is for).</p>

    <h1 id="title_6-3"><span class="number">3.</span>GROUP ACTIVITY</h1>
    <div>
        <p>The group leaders have to read the recommended activities as a preparation. It is not necessary to do all activities. Be bold and try to choose from among the less comfortable activities as well! Consider the age of your group, but make sure you have some quiet activities and prayer, whether they are older or younger children.</p>

        </h2>
        <div>
            <p>If we want to make sure we are going to spend some beautiful and meaningful hours with the group, we have to tune into the group activity, to one another and God.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Arrange the classroom differently than on school days. Put the seats in a circle, so that you can talk together. Light a candle, place blankets and cushions around for a cosy atmosphere. Prepare a playlist with some pleasant, calm, instrumental music on your mobile phone, and have a speaker.</li>
				<li>Agree upon the rules of the group activity: attention, respect for each other, one person speaks at a time, no interruptions, trust, whatever we talk about here, we will not tell anyone outside this group.</li>
				<li>Tell the group that there will be individual work, silence, discussion, and sharing. Tell them about the importance of silence.</li>
				<li>Tell them when they can expect a break. (The group leaders decide the time of the break.)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Games are good ways to let the group members get used to being together, and quieten down. First play some livelier games, and after them some quieter ones.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is OK if they know the game already, they can play it again this time. It is always a new experience.</li>
                <li>You may need to play a quiet game after coming back from the break.</li>

            </ul>
            <div class="card">
                <p>„A man had two sons, and the younger son said to his father, ‚Father, give me the share of your
				estate that should come to me.’ So the father divided the property between them.</p>
				<p>After a few days, the younger son collected all his belongings and set off for a distant country
				where he squandered his inheritance on a life of dissipation. When he had freely spent everything,
				a severe famine struck that country, and he found himself in dire need. So he hired himself out to
				one of the local citizens who sent him to his farm to tend the swine. And he longed to eat his fill of
				the pods on which the swine fed, but nobody gave him any.</p>
				<p>Coming to his senses he thought, ‚How many of my father’s hired workers have more than enough
				food to eat, but here am I, dying of hunger. I shall get up and go to my father and I shall say to him,
				„Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I no longer deserve to be called your son;
				treat me as you would treat one of your hired workers.” So he got up and went back to his father.
				While he was still a long way off, his father caught sight of him, and was filled with compassion. He
				ran to his son, embraced him and kissed him. His son said to him, ‚Father, I have sinned against
				heaven and against you; I no longer deserve to be called your son.’</p>
				<p>But his father ordered his servants, ‚Quickly bring the finest robe and put it on him; put a ring on
				his finger and sandals on his feet. Take the fattened calf and slaughter it. Then let us celebrate with
				a feast, because this son of mine was dead, and has come to life again; he was lost, and has been
				found.’ Then the celebration began.</p>
				<p>(verses 25-31)</p>
				<p>Now the older son had been out in the field and, on his way back, as he neared the house, he heard
				the sound of music and dancing. He called one of the servants and asked what this might mean.
				The servant said to him, ‚Your brother has returned and your father has slaughtered the fattened
				calf because he has him back safe and sound.’ He became angry, and when he refused to enter the
				house, his father came out and pleaded with him.</p>
				<p>He said to his father in reply, ‚Look, all these years I served you and not once did I disobey your
				orders; yet you never gave me even a young goat to feast on with my friends. But when your son
				returns who swallowed up your property with prostitutes, for him you slaughter the fattened calf.’
				He said to him, My son, you are here with me always; everything I have is yours. But now we must
				celebrate and rejoice, because your brother was dead and has come to life again; he was lost and
				has been found.’”</p>

				<p>An example of how to tell the story simply with our own words:</p>
				<div class="card">                
                <p>Jesus told them one more story. It was about a young man who left the house of his parents, went
				to a faraway country and wasted all his money. When he had no money left, he did not know what
				to do. There was famine in that country at the time, and he was starving. He was so desperate that
				he took the worst possible of jobs: feeding the pigs in a pig farm. He was so hungry that he would
				have eaten even from the pigs’ food. Maybe that is what he ate actually. Then he thought to himself: “At home, in my father’s house the servants live much better than I live now. I will go back to
				my father, tell him how sorry I am that I have lived such a sinful life. I will tell him that I am truly
				sorry. I know I am not worthy to be called his son any more, but maybe he will take me back as
				his servant.”</p>
                <p>As he was approaching his home, his father saw him coming from afar. The father rejoiced and
				ran out of the house to meet him. He hugged his son. The young man said to his father: “Father,
				I know I have sinned. I am not worthy to be your son. Please, accept me as your servant.” But his
				father interrupted him and called his servants: “Hurry up, bring clean clothes, good shoes. Start
				cooking the nicest food because my son has come home!” They had a big celebration, they were all
				rejoicing, because the son returned home, to his father’s house.</p>

        <div>
            <p>The group leaders can choose the way they want to process the story based on the age of the group. You can change the order of the activities. You can do several activities, or just one or two but have more discussion. The important thing is that you look at all the possibilities before the retreat so that you know what to choose from.</p>
            <p>Be sure to leave enough time for the last activity, the examination of conscience and the closing prayer!</p>

                        „The tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to listen to him, but the Pharisees and scribes
						began to complain, saying, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.” So to them he
						addressed this parable. <quote>Ez bűnösökkel áll szóba és velük eszik.</quote> 
						“What man among you having a hundred sheep and losing one of them would not leave the ninety-nine in the desert and go after the lost one until he finds it? And when he does find it, he sets it on his shoulders with great joy and, upon his arrival home, he calls together his friends and neighbors and says to them, ‘Rejoice with me because I have found my lost sheep.’</p>
						<p>I tell you, in just the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance.</p>

						<p>And when she does find it, she calls together her friends and neighbors and says to them, ‘Rejoice with me because I have found the coin that I lost.’</p>

				<p>An example of telling these parables with our own words:</p>
				<div class="card">
                    <p>Jesus told them another story about a man who had one hundred sheep. One day a lamb strayed away from the flock. The shepherd immediately left the rest of the herd and set out to look for him. He searched as long as he found him. He put the lamb around his neck and walked home. At home he told his friends: “Rejoice with me, I found the lost lamb.”</p>
                    <p>Jesus also explained the story: There is great happiness in Heaven when just one repents and returns to the right way. To repent means to be truly sorry for the sins we committed and decide that we will not sin again.</p>
                    <p>Jesus told them one more story about a woman. She had ten silver coins. That was all the money she had, but one day she lost a coin. She was looking for it everywhere in her house, took a broom and started cleaning, hoping that she would find it. And that is how she eventually found it. She was very happy. Hesus explained that it is exactly like that in Heaven too. Everybody, even the angels in Heaven are happy when a sinner repents.</p>

                <p><strong>Finding ourselves, sweeping out our sins</strong></p>
				
                <p>We sometimes get lost too. We roll off to a dark, dusty corner, where, because of our sins, we can’t see how beautiful and good we are. Let us try to list everything we do that prevents us from seeing our own goodness.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Write down your sins</strong> on a small piece of scrap paper, one sin on each one. Scatter the pieces of paper around on the floor. (Every group member can write down a few, it does not matter if there are duplicates. Examples: “I do not obey my parents. I lied. I am too lazy to help at home. I did not comfort my friend. I betrayed my friend. I deliberately quarrel with… etc.” Choose examples from family life and school.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Everybody writes their name on their white cloth</strong>and makes a tight ball out of it. The balls represent us. Roll away the ball on the floor among the many sins. Hide ourselves under the scrap paper.</li>
                    <li><strong>Let us contemplate the chaos.</strong> We can write further sins on scrap papers if anything comes to mind. </li>
					<li><strong>Read the story again,</strong> and emphasize the part about the woman searching and sweeping her house.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Talk about the theme </strong>along these or similar questions: What would you want God to find? The many bad things, or us? What would we like this room to be? Where do we want the balls to be? Where shall our mistakes and sins be? Nowhere? Do we want them not to exist at all? Shall they be in the corner? Or shall we sweep the room?</p>
                <p><strong>After the discussion, sweep the floor together</strong> and solemnly tidy up the whole room. Sweep all the rubbish, but be careful not to sweep up ourselves (the balls). Let us pick up all the scrap paper, tear them up into tiny pieces, and throw them in the dustbin. Let everything bad be thrown away, and only we and our goodness will stay on the floor.</p>
                <p>Now let us collect ourselves. We can place all the balls in the center of the room. We can untie the knots to see the names, and see how clean we are. (Actually, the white fabric is not really clean any more, but that is what we are. It is all right.)</p>
                <p><strong>Discuss deeper questions.</strong>  Here is a list of helping questions. The group leader should choose from these the ones he thinks will help the group.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How difficult was it to find sins?</li>
                    <li>What did you feel when you saw that everybody else is throwing down more and more sins next to your own? (Did you think yours were becoming less important? Or did new sins come to your mind?)</li>
                    <li>Do you sometimes tidy up your room and throw away things like this? Do you do it in your soul sometimes?</li>
                    <li>What did you feel when you saw your white ball among the sins? What did it feel like after throwing away all the papers and there was only us without sins?</li>
                    <li>Do you feel something similar after confession? Do you go to confession?</li>
                </ul>

            <div>
                <p>The prodigal son went quite far away from his home. When we look at our cloth, we can see that we are not that close either. Where are we? Where would we like to return from?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mark a place</strong> in the room that represents the parental home with God in it, who allowed us to leave, and now he is waiting for us, whatever we have done. You can mark this point with a crucifix, a candle or another symbol.</li>
                    <li><strong>Find the place where you are now (take your linen).</strong> How far away are you from the home? What body posture represents your situation? (E.g.: squatting, turning your back, stretching out your arm toward God, staring at your navel?)</li>
                    <li><strong>Try out other</strong> places and postures, maybe they better represent the reality in your soul.</li>
                    <li><strong>Listen to the story staying in this position.</strong> Read the story of the Prodigal son until verse 19 when he decides to go home.</li>
                    <li><strong>Now listen to the father’s reactions:</strong> Read the end of the story, you can add your own words to make it more lively.</li>
                    <li><strong>In silence, with little steps</strong>, everybody approaches the Father who is waiting for him. The group meets in front of the Father. Say the Lord’s prayer to let Him know what you ask of Him.</li>

            </h4>
            <div>
                <p>We silently collect words that will gradually convey our message.</p>
                <p>Put three sheets of A3 paper in the centre of the room. They do not have to touch. </p>
                <p>Listen to the story again. What is our central theme? What are the most important words that come to our mind? (Is it already boring that we have to listen to the story so many times? Let us be patient, and listen to the story again and again.)</p>
                <p>Everybody shares one word, expression or thought that comes to his mind. Repetitions are OK.</p>
                <tanacs>
                    <p>With less mature groups it may be helpful to ask everybody to bow their head and keep it down until they find the word or expression. Then they can look up. This way we can help the children to decide upon their own word and not just repeat someone else’s.</p>
                </tanacs>
                <ul>
					<li>Write down the three most frequently used words on a sheet. Write neatly, with block capital letters, so that everyone can read it easily. If there were only two strong words, let the group vote on the third one. (Let the group decide on these 3 words, do not try to control the choice, whatever these are. It is really not necessary to choose “sin”, “Forgiveness” and “God”).</li>
					<li>Stay in silence for a few minutes.</li>
                    <li>Everybody writes some words on each sheet related to the word on it. Anything that feels important or comes to mind. If it is similar to the word on the paper, write your word very near it.</li>
                    <li>Stay in silence for a while, and then say: <quote>Read the words the others wrote. If it brings something else to mind, write it down next to it with smaller letters.</quote></li>
                    <li>Continue like that several times. Spend enough time on this activity. Maybe they are too shy to write first. Just wait until the ice breaks. Keep the silence.</li>
                    <li>Continue for ten minutes. Patience.</li>
                    <li>Read the story again at one point, or say it with your own words.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Discussion</p>
                <p>At the end of this activity read some more interesting parts. Do not try to find who wrote the word. rather:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I feel that this topic is important for us. Can anybody give us an example of when this happened?</li>
                    <li>How does it relate to the Scripture passage?</li>
                    <li>Cross your feet if you have ever experienced something like that, or if it is important for you.</li>
                    <li>If we ask the Father who was left at home, what do you think He would say? We can ask the children to be brave and speak in the first person like? “I, the Father, would like you to know that...” This is quite a bold step, and the children may be afraid to speak like that, but it can turn out very well in a group whose members are more open.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Discuss the Father waiting at home, and talk about yourselves.</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Tell a story about someone hurting you (deliberately or by accident), and you were able to forgive.</li>

            <div>
                <p>If there is time, a dramatization of the story may be helpful. It is not absolutely essential, and certainly not every group can do it, but it could be very useful for the children.</p>
                <p>Close your eyes and listen to the story. Try to feel which person you may be.</p>
                <tanacs>
                    <p>Ask the children to cross their legs while they are thinking, and uncross it only when they already know which character they will be in the story. This way everybody has time to think and we can wait for one another.</p>
                </tanacs>
                <p>In a round everyone tells the group which character he or she chose. (There is no wrong answer. It is ok to imagine oneself even in God’s place. Or the pig’s food. The important thing is to be serious about it.)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Which character can you imagine yourself as?</li>
                    <li>In what way are you similar to him? How would you like to be like that character?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Dramatize the story together.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assign the roles so that everyone has a part to play. Try to allocate the role he or she chose earlier. (There may be several of the same character. Or you may have two performances. It is OK to be a stone.</li>
                    <li>Mark the locations: home, faraway country etc.</li>
                    <li>The children go to the location where they are going to start the performance. When everyone is in place, the group leader asks them to close their eyes and imagine the whole story. Think through what they are going to do. (Encourage the children to add colorful details.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The performance can begin. It is ok if it is funny, if there are some jokes. But try to maintain some seriousness so that it is not empty clowning about.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The group leaders can encourage the children to make the skit longer. For example: <quote>You are the son. Take your time saying goodbye to your father. What are you telling him? Tell him everything you want before you leave!</quote></li>
                    <li>The other actors wait and listen until it is their turn.</li>
                    <li>Stop the performance from time to time and direct the attention to another character in the background. For example, while the son is having a drinking party abroad, freeze the skit, and ask the group to look at what the father is doing at home. Ask the father to start performing. What does the father feel?</li>
                    <li>Interview the actors during the skit. Freeze the performance, and ask the son’s drinking buddies in the party what they think about the son. Is he a good guy? Is he cool? Does he love his father? What do they know about him?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Discussion</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Who were you in the skit? What did you find difficult? What was easy for you? Were you surprised at something? What was different from the Scripture passage?</li>
                    <li>What else would you add? What did it tell you?</li>
                </ul>

            <p>As we are reading the story of the prodigal son we all look into ourselves: How was it, when we did wrong things or made a wrong choice? How do we turn away from God again and again? This is a sort of an examination of conscience, when we quietly review our deviations. For younger children these are usually breaking rules and regulations given by authorities: the parents and the school. For older children the relational sins get more emphasis: omissions, and hurting someone.</p>
            <p>Prepare the accessories. For the younger groups use paint, brushes, water. Older children just use pens.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <p>God is asking you to love Him with all your heart, all your soul and with all your will.<br>
                        I deliberately did not talk to God… I did not pray, and avoided Holy Mass.<br>
						I was not grateful for the many good things in my life. I was not willing to learn about the faith (For example, I did not pay attention in religion class.)</p>
                    <p>We are to love our friends, neighbours and enemies….<br>
						I deliberately disobeyed my parents, teachers, and acted contrary to their advice. I did not tell them something important despite knowing I should let them know.I deliberately did not help someone, although they asked me, and I could have helped.<br>
						I lied to somebody or betrayed him.<br>
						I did not care about my classmates. I did not comfort the sad one, although I could have. I tempted my friend to do something bad. I was envious, or wished someone ill. I did something bad against somebody. I was teasing, mocking or excluding someone. I did it offline or online. I saw serious bullying, or something really wrong, but I did not tell an adult who could have helped.</p>
                    <p>God is calling us to love ourselves too. <br>
                        I risked my own health or safety. I did not do something good that I could have. I used bad, ugly language, and obscene words. I excessively ate, drank, or sat in front of the computer without caring for myself.
                    </p>
                    <p>God gave us the created world to take care of.<br>

                <p>Sometimes the children really enjoy making their linens dirty. It is not a bad thing. In such cases we can tell them the following:</p>
                <p>
                    <quote>Oftentimes, unfortunately we actually have a good time when we commit sin. Just like the way you enjoy smearing paint on your linens. We do not commit sins to feel bad. On the contrary. We lie because at the time it may be more comfortable than telling the truth. We hurt someone so that we can enjoy having power over him, etc. But somehow we are not happy in the end. Somehow these bad actions do not help us to be happier. As you are smearing beautiful colours on the whine linen, remember that in the end it will look simply dirty and chaotic.”</p>
                <p>But there is hope: God is good. And He is happy to wash our dirty linens so that only the beautiful colors stay. We just have to ask Him. We just have to tell Him, “I am sorry, it has become too dirty. Please help!</quote>

                        I deliberately did not talk to God… I did not pray, and avoided Holy Mass.<br>
						I was not grateful for the many good things in my life. I was not willing to learn about the faith (For example, I did not pay attention in religion class.)</p>
                    <p>We are to love our friends, neighbours and enemies….<br>
						I deliberately disobeyed my parents, teachers, and did contrary to their advice. I did not tell them something important despite knowing I should let them know. I deliberately did not help someone, although they asked me, and I could have helped.<br>
						I lied to somebody or betrayed him.<br>
						I did not care about my classmates. I did not comfort the sad one, although I could have. I tempted my friend to do something bad. I was envious, or wished someone ill. I did something bad against somebody. I was teasing, mocking or excluding someone. I did it offline or online. I saw serious bullying, or something really wrong, but I did not tell an adult who could have helped.

                    <p>God is calling us to love ourselves too.<br>
                        I risked my own health or safety. I did not do something good that I could have. I used bad, ugly language, and obscene words. I excessively ate, drank, or sat in front of the computer without caring for myself.</p>
                    <p>God gave us the created world to take care of it.<br>
                        I damaged the environment. I littered. I allowed someone else to do so. I deliberately destroyed nature. I was wasteful. I spent money on things I did not need.</p>

Let us talk to the Father, and thank Him for something that He had given us to take us back home to Him.

        <div>
            <p>No matter how many times we get dirty or turn our backs on God, the Father forgives us again and again. He gives us his cleansing love through the people around us.</p>
            <p>A large washing machine is awaiting the children in front of the church or in a location where there is enough space for all the classes. This washing machine is a sign of God washing away our sins.</p>
            <otlet>
                <p>We can paint the symbolic washing machine on a big sheet or build one from cardboard boxes. We can write Scripture verses next to the program buttons.</p>
                <p>We can ask one class to prepare the washing machine well before the retreat. Usually the children happily do such creative projects in an art lesson.</p>
            </otlet>
            <p>There are “cleansing points” in a circle as the gates in an airport.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The class teachers are waiting for the students at each point with a large, empty basin.</li>
                <li>There are clean strips of white linen prepared at each point.</li>
                <li>The class teachers have a piece of paper with Psalm 103:12 written on it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The students line up at the cleansing point of their class.</p>
            <p>They stand in front of their class teacher one by one.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Class teacher: <quote>Do you want to be clean and good again?</quote> Student: <quote>Yes, I do.</quote></li>
                <li><quote>As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our sins from us.</quote></li>
                <li>The class teacher asks the student for the dirty linen, throws it into the basin, and gives him a clean linen. Taking the clean linen the student enters the church.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The students take their seats in the church. (Some teachers or group leaders coordinate this.) The students practise songs while they are waiting for everybody to take their seats.</p>
            <p>At the end the class teachers put all the dirty linens into the washing machine and they carry it into the church.</p>

        <h1 id="title_6-5"><span class="number">5.</span>HOLY MASS</h1>
        <div>
            <p>We will take our cleansed selves (the white linens) And hang them on the trees. We divide the participants into three groups (by age or seats), and these groups will bring their linens during the penitential rite, the offertory and at the sign of peace.</p>

			<p>While in small groups, practise/learn one or two of the songs of the mass</p>
                
            <h4 id="title_6-5-1-1-2">RECOMMENDED SCRIPTURE</h4>
            <div>
                <p>Reading | Micah 7:18-20</p>
                <p>Gospel about the Father | Lk 15:11-24</p>
            </div>
            <h4 id="title_6-5-1-1-3">AS PART OF THE PENITENTIAL RITE</h4>
            <div>
                <p>During the silence of the examination of conscience read the story about the train journey from the beginning of the retreat. Then while we sing the ‘Lord have mercy’ the first third of the groups bring their white linens in an orderly manner, row by row, and hang them on the trees.</p>
            </div>

            <h4 id="title_6-5-1-1-4">DURING THE OFFERTORY</h4>
            <div>
                <p><quote>Let us bring our white linens that represent our cleansed selves, so that God can make us the signs of His merciful, forgiving love for the world.</quote></p>
				<p>The second group brings their linens and hangs them on the trees while everybody sings.</p>
            </div>

            <h4 id="title_6-5-1-1-5">AFTER THE LORD’S PRAYER — BEFORE THE AGNUS DEI</h4>
            <div>
                <p>
                    <quote> We have just asked God to forgive our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Let us pass on his forgiveness with shaking hands. And let us bring this forgiveness in the white linens to these trees next to the altar, so that whoever comes into this church can see that God indeed forgives.</quote>
                </p>
                <p>We sing a song about peace and the third group brings their linens. When everyone returns to their seats we can start the Agnus Dei song.</p>
            </div>

            <h4 id="title_6-5-1-1-6">CLOSING</h4>
            <div>
                <p>We can tell the children to take home one white linen to remind him of this day. They can make something out of it, either by painting it with pretty colours or writing something on it.</p>
