    <p> As a Christian high school we organize Ignatian retreats several times every year for the whole
      student body - over 800 children. Our goal is to create opportunities for spiritual growth, moments
      when the children may encounter God, and become aware of meeting Him. These retreats last
      for four hours, and are built around symbols and hands-on, creative activities. Small groups of
      students work, talk and pray together, and the activities are facilitated by peers. The tradition of
      these retreats started over ten years ago in the Jezsu, the only Jesuit high school in Hungary,
      therefore a vast amount of retreat materials have piled up in the school chaplaincy. Based on the
      accumulated materials and experience, this handbook contains the detailed description of some
      actual events, the theoretical foundation behind them, and quite a few useful tips that may help
      you create your own original program.</p>
    <p>We hope this book will help the reader create and organize their own school retreats. We would
      like to encourage you to shape the materials according to the needs and possibilities of your
      school.</p>
    <p>The major part of this book contains six full, detailed retreat programs that we tried out and suc-
      cessfully completed. The topics, liturgical seasons of these programs and the age groups they
      are appropriate for vary. The programs contain detailed descriptions of how to prepare the event,
      and as soon as you have trained the group leaders and photocopied the pages, you can start
      the school retreat. There are tips and prompts placed in the texts to help the group facilitators be
      more confident and joyful while leading their groups.</p>
    <p>These ready-to-use retreat programs are available 
      at <a href="http://schoolretreats.jezsu.hu">schoolretreats.jezsu.hu</a> optimized for mobile
      devices as well so that the group facilitators can directly access them.</p>
    <p>Before the detailed description of the programs we devote a whole chapter to the basic principles
      and theoretical foundation that shape the unique style of our retreats. In it we write about among
      other things, our vision of the human person, the wonder of cooperation, the possibilities to teach
      silence and the central role of creativity and symbols. We also write about training peer group
      facilitators, and the importance of sharing. We hope these basic principles will help introduce not
      only the actual programs but also the foundations of our approach and style.</p>
    <p>There is a collection of tips and ideas for those who would like to create similar original programs
      by adopting the ones in this book to their local needs and circumstances. We supplement “The
      Journey” retreat with plenty of comments, recommendations and background information. This
      chapter contains all the experience and practical knowledge accumulated in the school chap-
      laincy: what to be alert to, why to use a certain game in a certain place, why the sequence of the
      programs, what can go wrong in an art session, how to help peer facilitators lead prayer, how to
      adapt a program to a different location, what we should know about managing time, etc.</p>
    <p>Group activities are the focal points in our retreats, therefore there is a whole chapter dedicated
      to the tips and ideas about how to lead a small group. These ideas, tips and methods will help all
      facilitators, booth peers and adults.</p>
    <p>We included the exact location of the scriptural passages along with the programs, and recom-
      mended games that are suitable to the liturgical season and to the program. You can find the list
      and detailed description of the games in Appendix No 2. We also recommend popular English
      songs to accompany each activity, but the retreat facilitators are encouraged to select songs to
      each activity from the Christian songs that are thematically and seasonally suitable to the retreat
      and appropriate for the young people in your school.</p>
    <p>Please write to us and let us know about your experiences and recommendations concerning
      these retreats. E-mail Fr. László Elek SJ at <a href="mailto:  laszloeleksj@gmail.com">laszloeleksj@gmail.com</a> címen.</p>
    <p>We hope our book will bear much fruit, and help our students and colleagues along their journey
      to God. The Lord has sown the seed, and we just water and care for the little seedlings. It is an
      important mission, and a great responsibility. In the meantime, however, we can rest assured:
      growth is not our work, it is given by God Himself, just as the fruit is a gift that comes from Him
      and not from us. We pray that we all can entrust our retreats, our students and ourselves into His
      hands.</p>
