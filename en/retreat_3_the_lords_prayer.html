  <title>RETREAT #3 — THE LORD’S PRAYER</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1 id="title_4-1"><span class="number">1.</span>MISSION RETREAT FOR SMALLER CHILDREN — INTRODUCTION</h1>
<div>
  <p>We organized a mission retreat in 2017 for 130 elementary school children in Fülöp, a small village school in eastern Hungary. The script of the retreat can be used by group leaders as is.</p>
  <p>This retreat is also perfectly suitable in an environment where people are just getting to know the faith and the Church. The Lord’s prayer is the most fundamental Christian prayer, an excellent way for the participants to start out on the journey to Christianity. They will be familiarized with what this prayer means in small groups according to their ages.</p>

    </table>
  </div>

  <h3 id="title_4-1-2">ACCESSORIES</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Group leaders will bring:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Blankets, a candle, anything that helps creating an ambiance in the group</li>
      <li>Quiet, meditative music and a player device (e.g.: Ludovico Einaudi)</li>
      <li>Lots of songs, games, joy</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="title_4-1-2-1">FOR THE VARIOUS AGE GROUPS </h4>
    <div>
      <p><strong>Coloring - for the youngest | 1-3rd graders</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>crayons, color pencils</li>
      </ul>
      <otlet>
        <p>if the children have their own art kits for school, ask them in time to bring them</p>
      </otlet>
      <ul>
        <li>Coloring pages about the Heavenly Father, print out at least four different kinds. Prepare more sheets members.</li>
        <li>You can print seven different colouring pictures related to the sentences in the Lord’s Prayer.<br/>
			For example: <a
            href=http://tukoraltaltalanyos.hupont.hu/4/miatyank>http://tukoraltaltalanyos.hupont.hu/4/miatyank</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Making flowers | 4-6th graders</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>scissors and pens</li>
        <li>40 cm long wooden skewers sticks or plant stakes - more than the number of children in the group</li>
        <li>color papers with simple flowers printed on them for the children to cut out. (3 flowers on an A4 sheet). Every child will have one flower at the end. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Painting stones| 7-8th graders</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>pens</li>
        <li>paint and painting brushes</li>
        <li>pebbles and smaller rocks</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>For the Holy Mass</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>a big vase for the flowers</li>
        <li>big white sheet or tablecloth and pins. The white cloth will hang from the altar, and we pin the drawings on it. (we can place a large styrofoam board behind the sheet to which we can pin the pictures much easier)</li>
        <li>an old newspaper for the Melting Ice Floe game</li>
      </ul>
      <otlet>
        <p>Prepare the group leaders before the retreat, play the games and do all the planned activities. You can alter the activities according to the number of participants and the local circumstances.</p>
        <p>The group leaders may find it helpful to read the relevant part from <a href=https://issuu.com/maranatha2> YouCat - Youth Catechism of the Catholic Church</a>  (points 511-527.)</p>
        <p>We can make a paraphrase of the Lord’s Prayer, by formulating the seven requests with our own words, as it is most understandable for us. This way every sentence will be our own, even when sometimes we just mechanically repeat them. For example, instead of ‘Give us this day our daily bread’ we can say ‘Please always give us food to eat, something to drink, and friends to share it with.’ The participants can create their own paraphrases on their own or in small groups.</p>

<h1 id="title_4-2"><span class="number">2.</span>START</h1>
<div>

  <h2 id="title_4-2-1"><span class="number">2.1.</span>ASSEMBLY <ido>15 MINUTES</ido>
  </h2>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>Everybody meets in their own classrooms. The group leaders also start in their own classrooms, they will join their groups later.</li>
      <li>The teachers distribute the mid morning snacks that everyone can eat later during the break.</li>
      <li>The group leaders go to the classrooms where their groups are.</li>
      <li>Divide the children into small groups in the classroom, and proceed to the location of the starting activity. It can be a large hall or a suitable place outdoors, where everyone can gather comfortably and hear what is happening.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2 id="title_4-2-2"><span class="number">2.2.</span>STARTING TOGETHER, GETTING IN THE MOOD <ido>15 MINUTES</ido>
  </h2>
  <div>
    <p>The students gather in the location where they normally have assemblies or outdoors. It is very important to have a good sound system.</p>
	
    <otlet>Do not worry if the weather is not ideal. Everyone can endure a bit of cold weather for 15 minutes.</otlet>

    <p>Start with singing to help the children quieten down and get in the mood. Choose a song that everybody knows. E.g.: Little Life (For You Jesus) by Hillsong Kids, Our Father by Bethel Music & Jenn Johnson.</p>

    <p>We <strong>greet the children</strong> and introduce the group leaders. (The group leaders stand in the front by the leaders of the retreat. )</p>
    <p>We <strong>announce the program</strong> of the day: We will be doing activities in small groups and gather again for Holy mass. Then all have lunch as usual. </p>
    <p><strong>We introduce the theme, the Lord’s Prayer</strong> with a few sentences:</p>

    <p>
      <quote>What is the most important prayer of the Church? The prayer that Jesus taught us? Do you know? Those who know how to say this prayer raise your hands!</p>
    <p>Imagine, every Christian all over the whole world knows this prayer. Little children know it in Africa, families pray it together in Australia... Your headmaster also knows it. And the Pope prays it every day. More than once.</p>
    <p>Everything that is really important is in this prayer even if we do not always notice it: That we are the children of God, and we all belong to one family. That we all are longing for the love of God, and that other people can see it too. That God loves us just as we are, body and soul. And that although we all would like to be good, it is not always easy. (Who would like to be really good?)<br>
     Today you will get to know the Lord’s prayer a little better. The group leaders will help you. Maybe you will discover something interesting. We hope that the games, (yes, there will be games!) discussions, prayers and creative activities (please, bring your creations to the Holy Mass at the end!) will help you get to know God, who is our Father.</quote></p>
    <p><strong>Announcements</strong>. We repeat the program of the day. It is important that we clearly announce the exact time and place where people ought to be. Announce when they are going to have their snacks.</p>
    <p><strong>The groups go to their rooms</strong>.The teachers may need to help the children find their groups according to the prepared lists. The teachers may accompany the groups to the previously arranged locations so that nobody gets lost. Then the teachers may leave the children with the group leaders. We trust that the group leaders will be able to handle the group, or call for help if necessary.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h1 id="title_4-3"><span class="number">3.</span>GROUP ACTIVITY <ido>ALMOST 2 HOURS</ido><br>
  <cimkieg>You can include a break at a suitable time, but make sure you do not disturb other groups.</cimkieg>
</h1>
<div>
  <p>The most important part of a retreat is the small group activity. The room should be welcoming and cosy. Seats or blankets placed in a circle, a candle in the center, soothing, pleasant music. This should be prepared beforehand, or at the beginning of the activity, together with the group. </p>

  <h2 id="title_4-3-1"><span class="number">3.1.</span>WARM-UP AND INTRODUCTION <ido>20 MINUTES</ido>
  </h2>
  <div>
    <p>The introduction games help everybody arrive and get in the mood for the retreat. We move, meet and quieten down by the end. Let us spend enough time on them. (Choose one or two that you liked the most during the preparation session, that was the best experience for you. There is not enough time to play all.)</p>

  </h2>
  <div>
    <p>Each line of the Lord’s prayer is accompanied by a movement. It helps the children memorize it.</p>
	
    <p><strong>Show the movement line by line.</strong> The group repeats the words and the movement after each line. Then you say the whole prayer together.</p>
    <p>All age groups learn the same movements.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <p> Our Father who art in heaven,<br/>
		- We point to the sky with one arm<br/>
		Holy be your name;<br/>
		- Stretch both arms to the sky<br/>
		Your kingdom come;<br/>
		- We make a welcoming movement with our arms<br/>
		Your will be done<br/>
		- We bow down with the right hand on our heart<br/>
		On earth as it is in heaven<br/>
		- We point to the sky and then to the room around us.<br/>
		Give us this day our daily bread;<br/>
		- We hold out both hands as if begging.<br/>
		And forgive us our sins,<br/>
		- We cross our hands on our chests and bow our heads<br/>
		as we forgive those who sin against us.<br/>
		- We shake hands with people around us (there will be a bit of a confusion, but that is ok. )<br/>
		Lead us not into temptation<br/>
		- We make a stop sign by holding out our hands<br/>
		But deliver us from evil.<br/>
		- We cross our hands on our chest and then open up our arms<br/>
		For yours is the kingdom, the power and the glory forever and ever<br/>
		- We point all around with raised arms<br/>
		(We all say loudly:) Amen<br/>
		- We put our hands together as in prayer.

  <h2 id="title_4-3-3"><span class="number">3.3.</span>LEARNING A SONG — ANY TIME DURING THE RETREAT <ido>10 MINUTES</ido>
  </h2>
  <div>
    <p>If you all get a bit tired, sing a song. Learning a happy song with movements is as good as a good game.</p>
    <p>For older children you can choose songs from the songbook your community uses at Holy Mass.</p>
	
  </div>

  <h2 id="title_4-3-4"><span class="number">3.4.</span>DISCUSSION <ido>20 MINUTES</ido>
  </h2>
  <div>
    <p>The purpose is to have a good discussion about God and things that are important to us. Make sure everybody has an opportunity to talk. It may be a novel experience for the group, so do not expect too much. The group leader can share something about himself, and encourage the group members to talk about their feelings and experiences. When the group runs out of things to talk about, you can insert an activity and then continue with more talking. It is easier to have a good discussion with older children about inner qualities and stories.</p>

    <tanacs><p>Do not be afraid to ask serious questions. Even little children can be asked things like <quote>What do you think, how do we know what God wants?</quote>. Do not expect very young children to respond with things you, group leaders would say. The goal is that they get used to talking about God, and it feels natural for them, even though at the beginning it may feel new and unusual. </p></tanacs>

    <p><strong>Themes and helping questions</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <quote>Which is your favorite part of the Lord’s prayer now? What is the request you need to ask the most?</quote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <quote>Tell us about an example when one God answered your request... about when you eventually forgave someone… Was God’s will done on earth then? Did he deliver you from evil? Did He give you food and bread when there was hardly anything to eat?</quote>
      </li>
    </ul>
<tanacs><p>It is not necessary to talk about all these questions right here. You can return to them after the creative activity. You can alternate singing, talking, and art work.</p></tanacs>
    <p><strong>More questions</strong>: (For younger children, and for those who are not too familiar with Christianity)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <quote>Who is Jesus? What have you heard about Him?</quote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <quote>What kind of person is he? What did he look like? What did he like to eat? What was his job? How did he live?</quote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <quote>Did he have friends? Whom did he talk to? What was his family like? What kind of people did he get along with?</quote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <quote>What did he do? Whom did he help? Do you remember any of his miracles?</quote>
      </li>
     <ul>
        <li>Tell stories about how Jesus healed the sick (the blind, the paralytic, the lepers), and raised the dead (Lazarus).</li>
        <li>He taught people about how to live a better life, how to love one another, and how to live happily.</li>
        <li>He talked about God, our Heavenly Father, how much He loves us, and that He created us very Good.</li>
        <li>He taught us that we are all brothers and sisters and we should love one another. </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <quote>Did you know that Jesus had taught people the prayer we have just learnt? When did you first say this prayer? Did you know that many people really love this prayer? </quote>
      </li>
      </ul>
  </div>

  <h2 id="title_4-3-5"><span class="number">3.5.</span>REPEATING THE PRAYER WITH MOVEMENTS, LEARNING SONGS AND REPEATING THE SONGS</h2>
  <div>
    <p>Any time when the group leader feels the children may need a break, you can say the Lord’s prayer with the movements, sing a song or learn a new song. For this purpose have a list of songs (Songs from the Mass or other Christian children’s songs) ready that you can choose from.</p>
    <p>All age groups can learn new songs from the Mass.</p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="title_4-3-6"><span class="number">3.6.</span>ACTIVITIES FOR DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS</h2>
  <div>
    <h3 id="title_4-3-6-1">1-3RD GRADERS (5-8 YEARS OLD) — THE LORD’S PRAYER COLORING SHEETS</h3>
    <div>

      <p><strong>What can God be like? What is our Heavenly Father like? </strong>
         Some people imagine God as a policeman or a judge. But He is a father, a daddy: He is looking after us, we can hold on to Him, and He shows the way and the goal to his children. We would like to help the participants to be able to see God as their loving Father..</p>

      <h4 id="title_4-3-6-1-1">ACTIVITY</h4>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>Print coloring sheets for each request in the Lord’s prayer. Make sure all requests are distributed and everyone gets one coloring sheet.</li>
          <li>While the children are coloring their picture, you can play pleasant, instrumental music. There is plenty of time to color. </li>
          <li>Also you can tell a Bible story that is related to the theme while they are busy coloring. | E.g.: The story of the prodigal son (<a href=http://szentiras.hu/Lk15,11-32>Lk
              15:11-32</a>)</li>
          <li>Help the children color the picture. Encourage them to continue if they want to give up. Praise their choice of color, and stand by them as our Father is standing by us.</li>
          <li>When they are finished, tell them to draw themselves in the picture. Where are they standing? How do they look upon the Father?</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h4 id="title_4-3-6-1-2">QUIET OR LOUD ACTIVITY</h4>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>If the group was too quiet while coloring the pictures, you can insert a loud game with movement. You can sing a song, play a game, the children can go to the toilet. (Do not have a long break, but make it fun.)</li>
          <li>If the group starts becoming loud and excited during the coloring - which is not a problem at all - ask them to calm down again. Sing a quiet song or play a game that helps them.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h4 id="title_4-3-6-1-3">SERIOUS DISCUSSION | <ido>20 MINUTES</ido>

          </li>
          <li><quote>Show your pictures! Tell us something about it! Which is your favourite part in the picture?</quote> (Do not expect too much.)</li>
          <li>Ask the children what they see in the picture. They may say very simple things. Do not expect them to know anything about God. If they say something like <quote>‘A father is talking to some children</quote>, you can encourage them. <quote>Sure, Jesus was a grown man, and he liked to talk with little children. He also liked to play with them.</quote>
          </li>
          <li>Continue with more questions from <a href=#title_4-3-4> the previous session</a>.</li>

      <p>God’s kingdom is near, it is already among us. The good God who created us is here with us. He created us and the world around us good and beautiful. Let us notice it, let us rejoice in one another, in beauty, truth and goodness. We are going to collect such joyful and beautiful things; things that point to God’s kingdom among us.</p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <quote>What can be God’s purpose with all these good and beautiful things? What does it mean in the Lord’s Prayer when we say `Your will be done?´ What do you think it may mean? How do we know what God wants?</quote>

    <h3 id="title_4-3-6-3">7-8TH GRADERS (12-14 YEARS OLD) — “AND FORGIVE US OUR SINS, AS WE FORGIVE...” — STONES</h3>
    <div>
      <p><strong>The stones at the side of the road mark the way God’s kingdom will come among us.</strong>
        There are milestones along the road that show which way to go. In the prayer we asked that God’s kingdom come among us, that there will be peace and happiness in our village, in the school and in the whole world.</p>

          <li>
            The group starts collecting ideas about how we could make our immediate surroundings, our family, school, the village happier and more peaceful. (Do not expect great ideas, and it is ok if they do not talk about God. If they say something like ‘be kinder to mom, or protect the weaker children etc. It is also all right if someone wants to fight for world peace if he is serious.)</li>
          <li>→ Everyone gets a couple of stones. The children write a word or better, draw a picture on the stone that represents what they want to do in the future for a better world. One symbol per stone is enough.</li>
        </ul>
        <tanacs><p>The group leaders should walk around and help the children figure out what the symbol will be, what to write or draw. Help with ideas, and encourage the children that what they are doing is good.</p></tanacs>.

     <tanacs><p>It is just as well if somebody plans to start doing good after graduating from university. It is not important to come up with practical ideas, but to awaken the desire in our hearts to do something to make the world a better place, so that we can experience the kingdom of God here and now.</p></tanacs>

      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>The group leader tells the group that everybody is going to Holy Mass where we will celebrate the things we have learnt today about the Heavenly Father. Tell the children that we will say the prayer with movements during the Mass.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>In the Mass at the “Lord have mercy”</strong> The priest will call the children to place their stones to the two sides of the aisle leading up to the altar. The group leaders will help them.</p>

  <h3 id="title_4-3-6-4">RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GROUP LEADERS OF ALL AGE GROUPS </h3>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>Be flexible, alternate the activity types: discussion, singing, discussion, artwork etc…</li>
      <li>Yo can use the story by Max Lucado: You Are Special (In: Punchinello and the Wemmicks)</li>
      <li>Sing a lot. It is not a waste of time to sing with little children.</li>
      <li>Say the Lord’s prayer with movements again and again. </li>
	  <li>Learn a new song.</li>
    </ul>

<div>
  <otlet> <p>It is best to have a guitar, singing the happy songs the groups learnt earlier. Arrange a projector and show all the songs and the responses of the Mass.</p></otlet>
  <p>The group leaders sit with their groups during Mass and help them with the responses and the songs.</p>

  <p>Priest: <quote>and lead us to life everlasting.</quote> Response: <quote>Amen.</quote>  Priest (before the song): <quote> We have confessed our sins and repented, we want to walk on the way of righteousness. So please all who painted signs that lead to God’s kingdom on little stones…, everybody who made signs for the road that leads to goodness, bring their stones and place them on both sides of the aisle leading up to the altar.</quote> Song: “Lord have mercy...”</p>

  <div>
  <p>After the sermon and the prayer the priest says: <quote>The kingdom of God has already come and is here among us. We can see the good and beautiful things here. He gave us the wheat to make bread that will become the Body of Christ on the altar. He created the grapes for us to make wine that will become the Blood of Christ on the altar. As we sing, please bring your flowers… bring all the good and beautiful things for which we can be grateful and happy. These things show to us that the kingdom of God is already here. As God gives us something even more wonderful through the bread and wine, may these little flowers make God’s love real to us. </quote>

  <h4 id="title_4-4-6"> SANCTUS — THE YOUNGEST CHILDREN PIN THEIR PICTURES ON THE ALTAR</h4>
  <div>
  <p>Priest: <quote>...we sing… and while we sing, I would like to ask the youngest children to bring their pictures. Their pictures show each request we pray in the Lord’s prayer. Their colorful pictures show what we all think about the heavenly Father, our good God for whom we sing now together with all the angels.</quote> Song: “Holy, holy..."</p>

  <h4 id="title_4-4-7">WE SAY THE LORD’S PRAYER TOGETHER DOING THE MOVEMENTS </h4>
  <div></div>

  <h4 id="title_4-4-8">HOLY COMMUNION AND BLESSINGS</h4>
  <div>
  <p>Beszéljünk erről is, mert lehet, hogy a helyi hagyományok nem ismerik, vagy nem úgy ismerik, ahogy mi szoktuk.<br>Például felvezethetjük így:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The priest invites everybody to <strong>Holy Communion:</strong>
      <quote>The Lord is inviting us, even though we are not perfect. I encourage everybody who has had their first communion - unless he committed some very grave sin - to receive the Holy Communion. (If you are in the state of grave sin, there is a solution for you, go to confession.)</quote>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Give a blessing</strong> (drawing a little cross on the forehead) to those who do not take Holy Communion. (There will be very few communicants, many of them are too young, invite only the communicants first, and then invite everybody else for a solemn little blessing, while everybody sings.)</li>
  </ul>
</div>

  <h4 id="title_4-4-9">CLOSING, BLESSING AND DISMISSAL</h4>
  <div>
  <p>After the Holy Communion and the prayer you can say thanks to everybody, make announcements and close the retreat.</p>
  <otlet><p>Ask the priest to give a longer, more solemn blessing at the end. He may choose one from the Missal.</p></otlet>
  <p>t is very beautiful to have a great procession at the end. The group leaders can join the Assistance after the crossbearer and the candle bearers. The acolytes, concelebrant fathers and the celebrant priest will follow after. </p>
  <otlet><p>The group leaders together proceed from here to the closing discussion.</p></otlet>
</div>
</div>

<h1 id="title_4-5"><span class="number">5.</span>REFLECTION AND SHARING WITH THE GROUP LEADERS</h1>
<div>
  <p>The group leaders and the organizers of the retreat have a 30 minute reflection and sharing right after the Holy mass and before lunch.</p>
  <p>Thank you for your service!</p>
