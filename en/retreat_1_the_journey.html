    <h1 id="title_2-1"><span class="number">1.</span>INTRODUCTION — WE ARE COMPANIONS ON THE JOURNEY...</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Life is a journey. And although we make detours and deviate from the right path, we keep journeying on, with God and toward God. It is our great joy that we are not alone or without help. We have got everything in our <strong>bag</strong> that we have received in life so far: our upbringing, education, the knowledge of goodness, experiences, friends, parents. There are <strong>signposts</strong> to show the way, help making decisions, focusing our attention on what is right and good. <strong>Footprints</strong> along our own path reveal that there have always been helpers by our side, in every phase of our lives, and God has never been far away. The <strong>milestones</strong> of our lives mark the secure points where we can always return, even after having gone astray for a while. These milestones point us safely in the right direction.</p>
        <p>This retreat was held twice in the JEZSU, (Fényi Gyula Jesuit High School), in 2012 Lent and 2019 Advent.</p>

    <span>
        ̉<h1 id="title_2-2"><span class="number">2.</span>PREPARATION</h1>
        <div>
            <p>You do not have to prepare the retreat all alone. Find at least one helper. It is much easier to work together! </p>
            <p>Choose a theme for the retreat, or pick one of the retreats described in this book, and streamline it according to what you want to accomplish.</p>
            <p>If you decide to make your own, brand new retreat, start early enough to have plenty of time for each of the following steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Brainstorming</strong> about the symbol, the theme or fundamental idea. Do not try to choose from the ideas immediately after the brainstorming session. Sleep on it, let the ideas incubate, only and after a few days make your decision.</li>
				<li><strong>Guided prayer and discussion</strong> about the theme/symbol with a small group - these can be students in a separate session. After the guided prayer discuss the symbols, images and their possible meanings. At the end you may have a brainstorming session about the possible activities related to the theme and the symbols.</li>
				<li><strong>Draw a rough outline</strong> of the retreat, and think about what kind of possible activities, prayers, discussions, games, creative activities would best suit the theme. Plan the assembly input at the beginning.</li>
				<li><strong>Ask for help.</strong> Invite the religion teachers for a discussion and ask for their input. The religion teachers may know best whether the selected activities are suitable for each age group. They may have excellent ideas for more activities.</li>
				<li>The last step is to write a <strong>detailed and accurate description</strong> of the whole program. It takes a lot of time and effort, but if you have a good documentation of each activity, you can use it later.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Invitations.</strong> Invite the group leaders, teachers and peer leaders. A personal invitation means a lot, especially for boys.</p>
            <p><strong>Preparatory session</strong> with the group leaders. You will try out the most important activities, play the selected games, and try out the creative activity. Such a preparatory session with the group leaders will help fine-tune the program. </p>
            <p><strong>Print out</strong> the detailed program and distribute it to all group leaders a few days before the retreat, so that they can study it and discuss the details. Print a few extra copies and have them ready on the day of the retreat in case some people leave them at home or have lost them. </p>
            <p><strong>Split the classes</strong> in small groups, match the groups and the group leaders and the locations for the group activities.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is best to ask the class teachers to split their classes into small groups. They know the personalities of children in their class the best, therefore they are the most qualified to decide on who to place in each group in order to strengthen community building in the class. They will make sure each group has quieter and more active children, and they know which children are not to be in the same group as together they may take the lead from the group leaders or be a negative influence on the group. </li>
                <li>Usually we ask class teachers to split their classes into groups. They really know the personalities of their students, so they are able to spread louder and quieter ones in good balance. It is important not to pair louder students all in one group as they can take the lead easily from the group leader, and anyway mixing characters up can support the cohesion of the class. </li>
                <li>→ The group leaders can suggest whom they would like to work with. We prefer putting more experienced group leaders along with less experienced ones, instead of pairing them on the basis of friendship. Students always lead groups in pairs, while teachers often work alone, although we have had good experiences with teachers working in pairs. The teachers need to be informed about their pairs in advance. Matching teachers with their groups can be done by a colleague.</li>
				<li>Allocating suitable locations to each group is an important element of preparation. Usually we need all the rooms in the school, sometimes there is a group even in the headmaster’s office. Note, that younger children often finish the same activities faster than the older ones. When allocating the locations make sure the younger ones do not have to move through the room while the bigger children are in the middle of a profound conversation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Select a <strong>base</strong>, a central location where a <strong>teacher-on-duty</strong> is in charge throughout the whole retreat. This teacher will assist the group leaders, distribute accessories, name lists, handouts and copies of the program. The group leaders may come here for help any time they encounter difficulties, for example with a student - during the retreat.</p>
            <p>Logistics can be made more effective by <strong>printing out a big chart</strong> with the following information: group leaders, location, class/group. Duplicate the chart so that the group leaders can tear off their copy, leaving the same information for the teacher-on-duty. This way no one can make a mistake identifying a group, a location or anything else. The teacher-on-duty will see which group leaders have already taken their material with them and who is still missing.</p>

                <quote>Good morning everyone! We are together today to have a retreat, to walk towards God together in small groups. I and these students standing next to me would like to help you today. Let us start the day with singing, and after that we will show you something we brought for you today.</quote>
            </p>
            <otlet>
                <p>It is always good to sing. If the children do not know too many songs, this is the time to learn a new one. The new song can be repeated during the day several times: at the closing, in the Holy Mass, or even in small groups. If we want them to sing in their groups, we have to make sure the group leaders learn the song first.</p>
            </otlet>
            <p>
                <quote>Think about how many different ways people travel to school every day, and how many obstacles we may have. This is how we live our lives too, although often in real life we are even less sure about what to do, and we need even more help.</quote>
            </p>
            <p><strong>The actors perform three skits.</strong> s. Every situation is read out loud and acted out by at least two persons. One character is the student who is on his/her way to school, and the other one is the angel accompanying him/her. The angel actively helps, saves him/her, moves things around to make sure everything goes well.</p>

            <otlet>
                <p>If there is a drama group in your school, they can be asked to perform the skits. The more students and teachers are involved, the stronger our community experience will be at the end.</p>
                <p>We can also ask one class to perform the skits, this way it may be easier for them to arrange the rehearsals either during religion class or with their class teacher. </p>
                <p>The preparation does not require too much time and effort if one or more students read the story while some others perform a mime. This way no one has to memorize the text. The setting can be minimalist, some smaller accessories like a schoolbag, a long rope or a steering wheel are enough.</p>
                <p>We can include the audience by using the premises creatively. For example, the characters can start acting in the back of the room, and they reach the microphone in the foreground only by the end of the skit. There they can take a seat waiting for the upcoming characters of the following scenes. This will suggest that all the scenes have a similar message.</p>

                <h4 id="title_2-2-4-1">STORY NUMBER ONE — A CABLE LINE TO SCHOOL</h4>
                <div>
                    <p>CHARACTERS — little girl, younger brother, angel</p>
                    <p>Daisy Mora wakes up every morning in the middle of a beautiful forest in Columbia, South America. She sleepily opens her eyes when the sun has just risen, sending its first rays to their small, two-bedroom wooden cottage through the lush foliage of the rainforest. A long way through the forest is awaiting her. After breakfast, she takes her school bag, a long hemp rope, a hook, a sack, and a steel pulley. She leaves holding her younger brother’s hand, as they are walking through the rainforest under the green canopy of the trees. The forest is beautiful, but one always has to be extremely alert, taking each step very carefully because of poisonous snakes. (The angel accompanies them, and helps them on their way. For example he catches a few invisible snakes and puts them down somewhere further away from the path.</p>
                    <p>They arrive at the edge of the forest. The view is breathtaking, they look upon a deep valley with the river cascading at the bottom. The school is on the other side of the river, over the deep valley. It would take 6 hours to get there on foot. The girl is taking a shorter route: a steel cable is expanded between the two sides of the valley. The steel cable is nearly 1000 metres (one kilometre) long and it is stretching 400 meters above the river. It looks quite terrifying. However, Daisy really wants to get to school. So she calmly places the steel pulley on the cable, pulls the rope over the trolley, and fastens it around her waist. (The angel helps fasten the rope and checks if everything is alright.) Daisy’s little brother climbs into the sack and she pulls its rope over the pulley too. And then, with a whoosh they slide down, flying between land and sky. It takes only about a minute, but she has to hold on very tightly during that time. She is holding a hook in her right hand, to slow herself somewhat. By the time they slow down and reach the other side, the friction has made the hook burning hot, almost smoking. (If they were sliding too fast the angel would catch them.)</p>
                    <p>Daisy’s younger brother climbs out of the sack, and they pack away the rope. They still have to walk about half an hour to the small school in the forest. Their journey was not easy, but they got there. Daisy wants to live her life like this: in a nice place, among loving people, and even if hardships come she faces them. (By this time the student reaches the stage, takes his/her school bag off, and sits down.</p>

                <h4 id="title_2-2-4-2">STORY NUMBER TWO — THIS IS HOW WE GO TO SCHOOL DAY BY DAY</h4>
                <div>
                    <p>CHARACTERS — boy, mother, bus driver, old man</p>
                    <p>Martin gets up on the 7th floor of a block of flats in a housing estate instead of the Colombian rainforest. He appears rubbing his eyes sleepily. It is not easy to get up although the sun is brightly shining outside. But God is looking at Martin smiling. He has already planned some pleasant little things for his beloved creatures.</p>
                    <p>There is no hot chocolate apparently. Again. Mom has some illness, but she does not speak about it. She gets tired all the time. Martin spoons some instant chocolate powder in his mug and puts it in the microwave oven. At least it is sweet. He tries to find something edible in the fridge. Finally he places the dirty mug and plate in the sink. But before leaving for school he turns back: “Poor mom, it must be hard for her. Especially if she wakes up as miserable as me…” He puts the kettle on, and places mom’s favorite mug on the counter. At least her day can start a bit better. God keeps smiling.</p>
                    <p>The bus is on time. Two mechanics stayed late last night in the garage to fix the loose steering wheel so it could run in the morning. Finally, a retired colleague helped them out with the tools they needed. He was on his way to the shops to buy a pen for his grandson. His grandchild wants to write a love letter with that to… You see, God had thought of some very kind little things which made it possible for the bus to be on time. </p>
                    <p>Martin is quite pleased with himself as he is thinking how happy his mom will be seeing the kettle and the mug prepared for her. He gets on the bus at the first door. He is still smiling happily as he is turning to the old man on the bus: is this seat taken? As he sits down next to the old man he doesn’t know how much his bright smile meant for him. The old gentleman’s day did not start very well, and up to this moment he has been preoccupied by his arthritis, the pain in his back, and that his supply of medicine was running out, and the neighbor’s baby crying all night. Martin’s smile turned his mind away from his problems, the old man felt that maybe the world is not such a bad place after all, as you can see there are some polite young people, and his own grandchildren are very sweet as they phone him every day on the way home from the kindergarten.</p>
                    <p>So nothing special happens on the way, there are no exciting events or problems to solve. God is still smiling and very pleased, as people did some good things that could be done that particular morning. Martin probably has not noticed buthe is not grumpy any more. He is eagerly looking forward to small, pleasant surprises: maybe this day will turn out relatively well in the end.</p>

                <h4 id="2-2-4-3">STORY NUMBER THREE — JOSEPH AND MARY</h4>
                <div>
                    <p>CHARACTERS — Joseph, Mary, waiter, bartender, two bricklayers</p>
                    <p>The young couple is preparing for a long journey. They are not a real couple yet, as they need some more documents to register their marriage in the office. But they do not have time for further arrangements, they have to leave. The almost-wife is expecting a baby. Now, when they have to pack and travel and are not yet sure where they will spend the night, her blessed condition feels more like a burden.</p>
                    <p>The journey is not easy. They are not half way when there is an accident and they have to evacuate the train and wait for the bus in the cold. Some strangers help them, giving them a warm cloak and seats. This is good but not enough to make the situation much easier. Hours pass with waiting, and then with slow traveling. </p>
                    <p>Eventually they are moving on. Due to the delay, they miss their connection and get stuck at the railway station of the small town. They have nothing, all shops are closed as it is Sunday evening. No sandwich bars or corner shops. Only the pub is open offering some salty snacks and peanuts. Not the best supper for a pregnant woman. And what is more, the room is full of thick smoke. But at least the pub is warm and the bartender tries to help them by lowering the music, airing the room a bit, and even the old alcoholics start to talk about nicer things: there is a small child among them, let him hear good words at least at the very beginning of his life.</p>
                    <p>The husband has left to find accommodation in the cold night. At a dark corner, he meets a waiter who has just finished cleaning. He has no family, no friends, and he is in a bad mood. He took them in for dinner. The odour of the drying disinfectant on the floor tiles mixes with the pleasant fragrance of roast chicken.</p>
                    <p>They keep talking over a bottle of wine, and fruit juice for the mother. They find it easier to share their sorrow and happiness with a stranger. It is such a nice feeling to be just who you are even for the time of a chat. By the time they finish dinner they are strangers no more.</p>
                    <p>It is late but there is still a lot of time before the bus leaves. They would need a place to rest. There are no hotels with affordable prices and a pregnant woman cannot spend the night under the bridge. Finally, the waiter thinks of a solution, they could sneak into the hostel for labourers. The receptionist seems to be quite shocked, but eventually he does not make a fuss. Two bricklayers share their room with the young couple. They lay down on the bunk beds.

            <p><quote>We heard about various people, children and adults, all traveling. Their journeys were all different. Sometimes we are not too enthusiastic early in the morning on our way to school. But I hope we all have some sense of purpose, why we set off to school every day. We all want to make friends, to meet them, we would like them to be nice to us, and we would like to be good to them. This is the way we all wish to get closer to God. And guess what, often angels give us a helping hand - as you could see in the skits - because we sometimes get tired on the way.</quote></p>
            <p><quote> Now the groups go away to their rooms with the group leaders where you will play, pray and talk about your journey. Try to find your way, your shared goals, and help each other while ‘traveling’, - and not only today.</quote></p>

            <p>Group leaders please find your groups. The classes stay in one place patiently so that your group leaders can find you!</p>
            <p>Find your group leading partners and go to the class where you will be leading a group. Let the children calm down and then start splitting the class.</p>

            <p>In the upcoming two and a half hours you will be with your group. You have to manage the time, make sure there are some breaks for socializing, and there is enough time for the activities, discussions, creating the symbols, and prayers. You must not skip prayers!</p>
            <otlet>
                <p>As creative activities can take a lot of time it is useful to announce on the loudspeakers of the school radio that the end of group work is coming. <quote>Dear students and group leaders, you have got 25 minutes left, please leave enough time for prayers and for tidying up the room. Bring your creations with you to Holy Mass.</quote></p>
                <p>This announcement can be quite disturbing if it comes while a group is praying. Therefore the group can pray earlier, and use the rest of the time before the end of the program to create the symbols and tidying up.</p>

            <h2 id="title_2-3-1"><span class="number">3.1.</span> PREPARING THE ACTIVITY <ido>15 MINUTES</ido>
            </h2>
            <div>
                <p>Prepare the group activities a few days in advance with your partner. Try out the games, think about the theme. Read the “How to lead a group“ section.</p>
                <otlet>
                    <p>One week before the actual program we present the content and the framework of the program to the group leaders. We have a mini-retreat with the group leaders, so that they experience the program themselves. They can be trusted to lead their group based on their own experiences.</p>
                    <p>It is essential that the group leaders try out the activities in advance. This way they will know by experience what they can expect and what the purpose of each activity is.</p>
                    <p>The goal of the preparatory retreat for group leaders is that they lead their groups without looking at the handouts all the time. It does not mean they have to memorize everything. But they can rely on their own experience, see which exercise works in what way and how, and what impact the activity may have on the group members.</p>
                    <p>We have to trust our leaders to choose the activities they like best. This way the event will have a much better impact on the group. Allow them to leave out activities that feel strange or uncomfortable.</p>
                </otlet>

                <p>Read the retreat manual together, select the activities you would like to do with the group. Choose the ones that both of you feel comfortable with. Do not force yourselves to do activities that seem too difficult or do not suit you. </p>				
                <p>We encourage you to definitely try the more complicated activities as well.</p>
				<p>There are activities that work better with younger students and there are some that are more suitable for older students. You will not have time for all of them, so select the ones which seem to be the best for your group.</p>

                <otlet>
                    <p>Hand over the retreat description to the group leaders well in advance. Share the retreat materials online (e.g.: Google document), from the beginning, so that they can see the framework even before the details are added.</p>
                    <p>Print several extra copies of the retreat program in case some group leaders leave theirs at home or lose them.</p>
                    <p>Encourage the group leaders to discuss the retreat in advance with their leading partners (they can invite other group leaders). Agree on how the two of them will lead the retreat. This is necessary even if they attended the preparatory session.</p>
                </otlet>
                <p><strong>Preparing the premises</strong> 15 minutes before the retreat</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prepare the room in advance. Arrange the chairs in a circle, it is easier to have a good discussion when the group members see each other. Avoid the classroom feeling.</li>
                    <li>Create a cozy atmosphere in the room, place some fabric in the centre, a candle, flowers, and you can bring some blankets and cushions.</li>
                    <li>Prepare a playlist of pleasant, calming instrumental music on your phone, bring speakers.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Two more important requests:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not hesitate to <strong>speak courageously about God and things related to faith</strong> during the discussion.
                </ul>
                <otlet>
                    <p>We have seen that if the group leader boldly talks about God and the faith, then the children will react to it and share their own, often very profound experiences and thoughts. It may happen even in groups where we expect it the least.</p>
                    <p>We have to make sure that the tasks are meaningful for everybody, even for people who do not feel close to God. For example if the task is to write a letter to God, we can suggest that they can choose to write it to an imaginary friend or a faraway relative as well.</p>
                </otlet>
                <ul>
                    <li>Include a quieter activity and prayer time in this section by all means, along with games and discussion about the stories. </li>
                </ul>

                <otlet>
                    <p>Less experienced group leaders often feel uncomfortable to lead prayer time. It is a new challenge and they may be anxious that the group will reject them. Encourage them again and again to be bold and try their best.</p>
                    <p>It is important to teach the children silence. It is much more than just being quiet. We can meet God and our own innermost self in silence. We can train our students little by little to leave the noise of ordinary days, get used to listening to quiet, peaceful music, and eventually to enter into a silence that is not forced but prayerful and alive. We should always remember to include silence in our retreats, and patiently persevere training our students.</p>
                    <p>Timing: older children enjoy discussions, so we can leave more time for their group activity. We may want to have two separate closing sessions and two separate Holy Masses one after the other, first for the younger classes, and then for the older ones, especially if the assembly hall or church is not large enough to hold everybody. This way the bigger children have more time for discussion. </p>

                <p>To spend a pleasant and meaningful time together with the group it is important to tune in to each other and also to God. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start by greeting and introducing yourself. The introduction can also be a game.</li>
                    <li>Set the rules of cooperation within the group: respect, listening, one speaks at a time, trust, and confidentiality (what is being said in the room, stays in the room).</li>

            <h2 id="title_2-3-3"><span class="number">3.3.</span>ICE BREAKERS <ido>20 MINUTES</ido>
            </h2>
            <div>
                <p>These activities can create a serious and trusting atmosphere that is necessary for further cooperation. The children get to know each other, to get closer to each other and learn to listen to one another. This is why we start the group activities with ice-breaking games. If the children do not know each other’s names, play name games first. After some playful, energizing activities, continue with games that are good for calming down, to create focus.</p>
                <otlet>
                    <p>The games listed in the retreat programs are described in the appendix. It is not enough just to read the descriptions! The group leaders must learn these games by playing them in advance, during the preparation. This way the group leaders experience the games, get a feel of the style and the pace they are supposed to be played, and sense how much time they should plan for them.</p>
                </otlet>
                <tanacs>
                    <p>It is not a problem if the group members already know the games. It is OK if some members are not too enthusiastic at the beginning. If they see that you enjoy the game, they will be drawn into it.</p>
                    <p>When you come back after a break, you will need some games to calm the group down. (do not choose energizing games!)</p>
                    <p>Avoid games where people drop out, it is important that everyone stays involved all the time.</p>
                </tanacs>
                <otlet>
                    <p>Playing games is not a waste of time but rather an essential and organic element of group dynamics. In a block of 2,5 hours, you can freely spend at least a 30 minute long period of playing. Games help group members get closer to each other and group leaders get to know the members better.</p>
                    <p>The games have three goals at the same time. They entertain, help group dynamics (either calm down or activate the group), and support the theme of the retreat.</p>
                    <p>The order of games is important: we move from active, noisy games toward quieter ones to calm the children down.</p>
                    <p>Active games involving physical contact help the children relate to each other and form a group. Physical closeness, grabbing one another, leaning on someone, holding or supporting the other person are essential preparatory phases of cooperation. Active games also help conquering the given space.</p>
                    <p>We play certain games to help the groups calm down. Therefore we should not expect the children to be quiet when we start these games; silence is the result, not the precondition. As they get more absorbed into the game, they will be able to concentrate better and quieten down.</p>
                </otlet>
                <tanacs>
                    <p>Have a short reflection time after more serious games. Reflection helps the children become more aware of what they experience.<br/>Ask a few children at the end of the game what they felt, what they sensed the others were feeling, what they found hard etc.</p>

                <p>You can also choose an activity to help communicate. For example, let the group line up according to the distance they live from school.

                    <p>In every retreat program there is a central symbol around which the whole program is built. In each variation of the program we include a creative activity, the children make a concrete object or art work, not just talk about the theme. This physical activity is usually a creative activity where group members actually make something that can be a good reminder of the day. Also, this activity involves silence and the experience of it, teaching them the positive characteristics of silence, but also talking is important together with reflection and deep focus. Never leave prayer out even if it is only a short part of the program.</p>
                    <p>It happens sometimes that we hand out all the age group variations of the program to all group leaders because they can get good ideas or games, maybe good questions for their own group from other versions.

                            <li><strong>Objects:</strong> that may be useful on the journey, things that help me to be better. It can be anything that makes me feel safer or more comfortable.</li>
							<li><strong>People:</strong> my parents who help me a lot (sometimes scold me), my brothers and sisters whom I can count on and who know me well (though they can be mean to me), friends who love me even when I am not too kind, or anyone else who is important to me.</li>
							<li><strong>Heroes, role models:</strong> Historical figures or even fictional characters whom I admire and want to imitate. (The children can draw pictures of them as well.) Biblical figures, like David, who tricked Goliath. Esther who risked her life for her people. Saints, like St Elizabeth of Hungary who continued to be generous to the poor even after she was expelled from her own castle. Saint Jadwinga who converted the Lithuanians with kindness and understanding and not with force. If any examples can help you you can put them in your bag.</li>

                        <p>Everybody is making a little shoulder bag out of A4 paper. The group leaders ought to make a few in advance so that they can help the group, and maybe show the prototype.</p>

                        <p>Stick or staple some string on them (70-80 cm long) to be able to hang them on your shoulder.</p>
                        <p>When the bags are ready, let the students decorate them. Anything they want to draw on them is ok, and also ask them to write their names on the satchels.</p>
                        <tanacs>
                            <p>Plan the timing carefully. Remember, the creative activity usually takes longer than planned, especially with younger students. Plan enough time for getting the accessories ready, explaining the task, discussion, and tidying up afterwards. This way you do not have to leave anything out of the program.</p>

                        <p>After decorating the bags, play a refreshing game with lots of physical activity and moving around. Choose some games from the list above. This can be followed by a quieter, calming game and then carry on with the program. </p>
                        <p>Sit in a circle and ask everybody to show their drawings and explain one item in their picture. Help them by asking questions. (It is not necessary to explain everything and there is not enough time, and it would be too much for the attention span of the children anyway) Make sure nobody criticizes anything in the pictures. Praise all drawings for both content and form.</p>
                        <otlet>
                            <p>When asking questions, keep in mind that younger children (5-8th graders) usually try to answer what they believe is expected from them. They unconsciously look for the “correct” answer. Therefore when we want to illustrate what kind of responses we expect we should try to bring many diverse examples of the possible “correct answers”, so that the children feel free to express their own opinions.</p>

                        <p>We start the solemn ceremony <strong>by lighting the candle</strong> in the centre. Sing a song to help calming down. We can practise the song we choose for the prayer or learn a song from the Holy Mass. This is not the formal prayer session yet.</p>
                        <p><strong>Read the Bible story</strong> of Jesus walking with the disciples to Emmaus | Lk 24:13-35</p>

                            <p>Introduce prayer time by telling the group that everybody is going to pray silently. Describe how it will be done and how long it will take. This helps the children to stay composed.</p>

                            <li>The children go to the center one by one to place their prayers around the candle. Then they proceed to the group leader who hands over their satchel.

                    <div>
                        <p>Place a big sheet of plain wrapping paper on the floor in the middle of the room. </p>
                        <p><strong>Draw a road</strong>: mark the starting point in one of the corners by writing “I am here now”. Draw the Sun in the diagonally opposite corner. That is going to be where you are heading. Write “My goal: God, happiness, accomplished life etc.” next to the Sun. Draw a meandering line symbolizing the road leading from the starting point to the goal. Explain what you are doing while making this diagram.</p>
                        <otlet>
                            <p>It is important not to write only God or salvation at the goal area. Simple concepts like happiness or an accomplished life may make more sense to some children than the idea of God. This way even those for whom God is not really important at the moment or those who have no faith at all are able to relate to the activity.</p>
                        </otlet>
                        <p><strong>Brainstorming:</strong> What can come up on our journey? What are the things or events that tempt or distract us? What are the things and events that help, guide and move us forward? What kind of roadsigns point us toward the route that God has prepared for us? What kind of roadsings lead us away from a godly life? What can help us make choices? Mark these things with simple pictures or symbols on the road map.</p>
                        <otlet>
                            <p>Any experience or message has a deeper impact if it is communicated not just verbally, but using the five senses, and then reflecting upon it. Try to accompany the spoken words - whenever possible - with an experience using the five senses. It can be visual, like a symbol or a picture. But it can be a movement, a sound, or even a scent to support the experience or the message of the activity.</p>
                            <p>When we brainstorm for ideas, we can rely on the imagination of the group. The things they think of may be superficial or trivial, but that is OK. Do not expect the group to list the values you, the group leader would. The purpose of every activity and every retreat is to take at least one small baby step forward from wherever the children are.</p>
                        </otlet>

                        <p>If your group is quite talkative, have two rounds, and let everyone speak without a set order. First list the things that can distract us from the right path: Whoever has the idea they immediately draw it on the paper. The second round is about the things that help us stay on the right path.</p>
                        <p>If there are children in the group who find it hard to speak up, ask everyone to bend their heads down and quietly think about what to say. As soon as someone is ready with the idea he/she can look up. The group members wait until everyone has thought of something to say, and will be able to pay attention to the others.</p>

                        <p><strong>Write a value concept</strong> (positive or negative) next to each place, picture or symbol. For example, under the word “friends”, we can write trust, belonging together, and community.</p>
                        <tanacs>
                            <p>Let the children talk about the upcoming ideas. Ask them about their own experiences related to the particular value or symbol.</p>
                            <p>When something seemingly worthless or a bad concept comes up as a positive value, try to figure out what made that person bring it up. For example if someone mentions a pub on the road side, for him or her it may mean a friendly conversation or even a community. Always try to dig deeper to find something positive, and mark it on our road map. There are no right and wrong answers as long as the group is open and honest.</p>

                        <p><strong>Mark what is important for you!</strong>

                        <p>If the group members cooperate well with one another, they may choose five or six main values that everyone will be able to accept as the most important guidelines.

                        <p>Work in pairs. Each pair will make two cardboard or paper arrows and write one important value or a dangerous negative concept on each. Stick or staple all the arrows on the signpost or on a big board. This will guide the group members on their journey.</p>

You can mark God with a symbol, for example with a star, you can draw Him as a person or in any other way that feels meaningful for you. You can also think about where God was in that situation, or where you feel He is now. Was he behind you or closeby? Close your eyes again and use your imagination.</quote>

                            <p>The children may want to spend more time than what you have planned thinking about those past events. Then 10 minutes is not enough. But If you feel they have finished earlier, finish the activity. Be flexible.</p>
                            <p>Guided meditations should not end abruptly. First gently remind them that we are finishing soon, allowing them to round up their thoughts. Allow them to arrive back in the present.</p>

                        <p>The purpose of sharing is to let everyone express what has happened in their souls during the meditation. Speaking about our emotions help process and clarify them, and sharing our struggles and joys may be helpful for the others who hear them. Make sure everybody has an opportunity to speak. Encourage the quieter students as well.</p>
                        <tanacs>
                            <p>A good will add the most value to the success of a retreat. Therefore if the group is willing to have a good talk, give them plenty of time.</p>
                            <p>Sometimes it is more helpful to ask a simple question and let the participants answer one after the other. You may let them have a free conversation later, but always help the group to keep the focus on the theme, and make sure everyone is given the opportunity to speak.</p>

                            <p>When the student has finished sharing, we can ask one or two questions about their picture, especially if they did not say too much. They are free to answer or pass. Do not ask too many questions, make sure there is time for everyone.</p>

                            <li>It may be important to mention the companions on our journey <quote>Look back on your life so far. Think of the people who have had some influence on you?

                            <li>Let us talk about God as well: <quote>How has your idea of God changed throughout your life? Can you recall how you imagined God when you were little?

                        <p>Everybody will be given a sheet of A4 paper and something to draw with.</p>

Remember, it is a quiet, meditative activity, and the commotion of distributing things may ruin the atmosphere. ‘Excuse me, this pen does not work, may I get another one?’ On the other hand, if you distribute the tools too early, and they have to hold on to them, it may also be distracting.</p>

                        <p><quote> Look back on your life and try to recall the memorable and important moments in your life (either because it was so beautiful, or because it was so hard). These need not be big events. Just things that have been important for you, like meeting someone, a friendship, an experience, or anything else that has had an impact on your personality or on your faith. </quote></p>
                        <otlet>
                            <p>Any memory or experience may be significant even if it is not positive or somewhat ambiguous. The purpose of the reflection is always to find what moves us, what is important for us, something that has a significance in our souls. Therefore in the closing reflection we do not ask the participants what they liked the most but what was the most meaningful or important for them. They will say something positive almost without exception, but there may be just one or two people who will understand themselves better and get closer to God by recalling difficult or painful memories.</p>

                            <p>Time passes at a slower pace in silence. We may think fifteen minutes have passed while in reality it was only three. So it is OK to measure the time with a watch or mobile phone. Be patient and let the group have enough time.</p>

                            <p>Some participants may think four events are too many. It may be helpful to encourage them to look upon their lives and discover that there have been more than one central or significant event in their lives. From time to time they have found themselves in new situations, had to make new decisions, and all these have shaped the person they are now. There may be others who think there have been much more than four significant events in their lives. Insisting on choosing just four may help these people to see their lives not as a puzzle of a million fragments but as a more structured picture. So this is why when giving the instructions, it is important to emphasize the number four. (Naturally, we will not scold anyone if at the end they draw more or less events on their roadmap.)</p>

                            <quote>Draw these four milestones on your roadmap in silence. After drawing each milestone, stop to think about what happened at the time. Why was it important for you?</quote>
                        </p>

                        <p>Some group members may ask if they can write as well. Answer that they should rather draw. The pictures need not be perfect, it is OK to draw simple sketches or symbols.</p>
                        <p>Allow enough time for this activity, even 10-15 minutes. It is helpful to let the group know at halftime how many minutes they still have.</p>
                        <p>If some people finish too early, ask them to think of people who accompanied, helped or supported them at those times. Ask these students to include these people somehow in the picture.</p>
                        <otlet>
                            <p>We start the reflection with our individual experiences. Then we realize that there have always been people around us. Then we can move on to find God.</p>
                            <p>The group leaders must learn to be flexible and sensitive when making the decision to move on or wait for the slower students. If we wait, some people may get bored and start disturbing the others. If we move on, some may miss out on some important steps.</p>
                            <p>We may solve this problem by offering the optional task of drawing travel companions around the milestones. This way everybody can start the most important task together: drawing God on their roadmaps.</p>

                        <p><strong>Where is God?</strong></p>

                            <quote>Now we have reached the hardest task: draw God at each milestone. How was He present there? What did you feel about Him? Where was He?Far away? Right behind you? Was He standing by you as a friend, or underneath, holding you up? Put Him in your picture. A simple symbol is enough. </quote>
                        </p>

                        <p>Give time to this task. Do not move on until almost everyone is ready. (If there are one or two really slow students, you need not wait for them)</p>

                        <p><strong>Reflexion</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            <quote>When you have finished, put your pen down. If you are not so satisfied with your picture, do not worry, you may improve it at home later. You can sit back now. Look at your road map. What feelings do you have? Are you satisfied? What else do you wish for to be on your road map? What would you like to ask from God now?</quote>
                        </p>

                        <p>You can let the children, especially the bigger ones, meditate on their road map for 4-5 minutes. Gently remind them of the questions and tell them it is about half-time after two minutes. <quote>Just contemplate your picture. Listen to your feelings. What are you longing for? What would you like to ask from God now?</quote>
                        </p>

                        <tanacs>
                            <p>It is only human to let our thoughts wander. This is why during guided meditation or guided prayer it is helpful to gently break the silence every two or three minutes to help the children get back on track, and focus. <quote>If your mind wanders, it is all right, just try to return.</quote></p>

                            <quote>Let us finish our reflection together: Glory to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, as in the beginning now and forever. Amen.</quote>

                    <h4 id="title_2-3-6-4-2">DISCUSSION — FROM THE DRAWING TO GOD</h4>
                    <div>
                        <p>This may be a good time for a short break, and insert an energizing game. Even without playing a game, at least do some stretches and move about for a while before sitting down again for the discussion.</p>
                        <tanacs>
                            <p>A good discussion may determine the success of a retreat. Do not worry about timing, a positive sharing experience is the best way to spend the time.</p>
                        </tanacs>
                        <otlet>
                            <p>After tasks that require concentration and focus the groups always need some variation: insert movement, physical exercise, liberating, joyful activities. However, we have to be careful about choosing the right time for such activities. <br>For example, had we inserted the break right after making the milestones, it would have ruined the atmosphere and the meditation would not have worked so well. By now, however, they have drawn almost every essential element on their roadmaps, so it will be easy for them to continue after an energizing break.</p>
                        </otlet>
                        <p>After a short break with physical exercise, stretching etc, sit down in a circle for sharing. Let everybody tell the group what they drew and especially share their feelings and thoughts that have come to mind during the milestone-making activity.</p>
                        <tanacs>
                            <p>Avoid sharing mere theories or philosophies, rather encourage genuine conversations about ourselves, and our own experiences. This is why we have started with individual work. The drawing is the conversation starter, the first questions are about the events they drew. From this we can move on to more abstract and really important issues.</p>

                            <p>If a student does not seem to open up easily, you can help them with some questions about their picture or the things they did not mention. But as a group leader, always accept if a member of the group does not want to answer a question. The children are free to speak about anything they want to and to the depth they feel able to at the time.</p>
							
                            <p>It is better to let the group speak in a random order than in the order of seating, but make sure nobody is left out.</p>
                        </tanacs>
                        <otlet>
                            <p>The random order of speaking allows everybody to start speaking only when they feel ready or brave enough. The discussion may take longer this way, because occasionally nobody wants to start talking. The group leader must make sure nobody is left out. It is easier and more efficient, especially with younger children, to let the group speak one after the other in the order of seating. The quality and depth of first sharing is usually quite normative, it will determine the quality of the rest, therefore the group leader has to choose the first speaker wisely.</p>
                        </otlet>
                        <p>Continue the discussion about topics that had already seemed important in the first sharing round. You need not go in seating order and it is not necessary to talk about everything but make sure everyone has the chance to speak.</p>
                        
						<p>Prompting questions, conversation starters:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Are we not alone? Who have been, are, and will be our companions? Can I trust that someone will always be there for me? What experiences do we have? How can we trust more?</li>
                            <li>Looking ahead into the future: what kind of milestones will come? Will it be hard? Who can I rely on?</li>
                            <li>It may be the time to ask questions about God: what experiences do we have with God? Is He always invisible? Does it mean He is not there? Does He help us? Let us share our experiences. It may be helpful for some of us to hear them.</li>
                            <li>We may return to the milestones and start anew by recalling positive things in our life. How can these positive experiences give strength to us on an ordinary day? Who has some tips and methods like keeping a diary or writing memory tags?</li>

The program organizers can’t be present in all the groups, therefore they do not know what may be the most important topic for each particular group. Let us believe in the groups and the group leaders. Let us hope and trust that they will have a profound and godly discussion. Some of the discussions may not be really deep, but at other times the children will remember them for weeks or months. The outcome does not depend on us.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>Make a big milestone together with the most important points of the group discussion. Give the group complete freedom. For example they may want to arrange the points on the different sides of the box (companions, memories, events, etc…).</p>
                        <tanacs>
                            <p>The creative activity always takes longer than planned. Preparation, giving instructions, tidying up afterwards take time. Plan well so that you have enough time remaining for prayer.</p>

                    <h4 id="title_2-3-6-4-4">PRAYER — GIVING THANKS </h4>
                    <div>
                        <p>Make sure there is at least 15 minutes left for prayer.</p>
                        <p>Tidy up and arrange the chairs in a circle. Place the milestone in the centre and light a candle. </p>
                        <p>Tell the group that you will pray together, how, and for how long. </p>
                        <otlet>
                            <p>When a group prays together it may cause some tension that some children are not sure what is allowed, when they “must” speak, what they are allowed to say etc. This can be helped with good instructions. Even during prayer you may want to tell them again and again what is happening next.</p>
                            <p>Giving the time frame also helps the group and the quality of prayer time. The children are able to focus better if they know how long they have to concentrate. </p>
                        </otlet>
                        <tanacs>
                            <p>Wait patiently until they calm down after returning from a lively and noisy activity. Avoid harsh disciplining at all cost, it would ruin the atmosphere, especially before prayer. Rather have the group play a calming game if necessary.

                        <otlet>
                            <p>Probably the most challenging task of group leading is guided prayer. This is why we always provide very detailed instructions for the group leaders. The group leaders ought to have had personal experience of this kind of prayer.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Start with making the sign of the cross: In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</li>
                            <li>Sing a Taizé chant e.g.: Bless the Lord my Soul ,reminding ourselves that each milestone is an important station on our journey towards salvation. Repeat five to eight times. Repetitive singing helps the children calm down. You can count the number of repetitions on your fingers.</li>

                                <quote>Let us give thanks to God for guiding us, leading us, so that we can choose what is right and good. We will pray in silence for a while, and then everybody can tell us what they are grateful for, what they want to thank God for. Start with the words ‘Thank you God for …., and finish with ‘Amen’. Then the group can respond with ‘Amen’. If you’d rather not share your prayer loudly, pray silently, and just say ‘Amen’ loudly when you have finished.</quote>

                            </li>
                            <li>Wait 30 seconds in silence. The group leader can measure the time because it is not easy to sense the time in silence.</li>
                            <li>After 30 seconds the group leader starts with their own thanksgiving prayer.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <otlet>
                            <p>The first prayer usually determines the quality and depth of the following ones. If the group leader is an adult, they may need some guidance formulating the first thanksgiving prayer. It has to be simple and short, similar to what a student would say. Its content has to be genuine, but as for its depth it has to be suitable for the children in the group. It is not suitable for the students to hear about a marital problem for example.</p>

        <h1 id="title_2-4"><span class="number">4.</span>HOLY MASS AND CLOSING </h1>
        <div>
            <otlet>
                <p>The Holy Mass is a celebration of the whole community. Try to include in the liturgy as many participants as possible giving them various little tasks. Talk it over with the celebrant priest beforehand.</p>
            </otlet>

            <h2 id="title_2-4-1"><span class="number">4.1.</span>PREPARING FOR HOLY MASS</h2>
            <div>
				<p>Agree upon the songs, readings, acolytes and the order of liturgy with the celebrant priest.</p>
                <otlet>
                    <p>Approach the celebrant priest well in advance before the retreat. Tell him about the objectives and the theme of the day. Recommend readings, and ask his permission to include some special elements in the liturgy. Be proactive, offer help and share ideas. Naturally the celebrant priest will make the final decision about all parts of the liturgy.</p>
                    <p>If the celebrant is a visiting priest, inform him about local traditions. Familiarize him with the usual way your school takes Holy Communion, if there is a special seating order, additional prayers at the end of the Holy Mass etc. He would like to know about these, and may or may not include them in the liturgy.</p>
                    <p>It is best if the celebrant priest is present and participates at the beginning of the retreat. This way he will sense what is going on and help the community better in the Holy Mass to be closer to God.</p>
                   <p>Have a group of staff invite the celebrant priest for coffee and snacks during the small group activities. Most priests enjoy a bit of attention. Such a gesture may contribute greatly to improving the relationship between the local parish priest and the school. Let us be bold and patient, it is worth it.</p>                   
                </otlet>
                <p>Musicians and members of the choir may leave when their groups start tidying up after the small group activity. Thus they have time to tune their instruments and prepare for the Holy Mass.</p>
                <otlet>
                    <p>Select the songs carefully so that they facilitate prayer and suit the liturgy. Choose beautiful songs that are suitable for young people.</p>
                    <p>A student band of guitarists and singers may be included in the liturgy. Even if they are not perfect, they can animate the worship very well. Make sure there is a good worship leader or choir master (usually a grown up), who can lead the whole community. Leading the worship is a task of high responsibility and importance.</p>
                    <p>During the preparation for the retreat you may ask the music teachers to teach some of the songs to the grades they work with. Also, the group leaders may include singing practice in the small group activities.</p>
                    <p>We can include learning a new song in the small group activity, as we have in the Retreat About the Lord’s Prayer, but then it is essential for the group leaders to know the song very well. Pick songs that are fitting in with the theme of the retreat.</p>
                </otlet>
                
                <p>Recommended songs: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Blessed be Your Name by Matt Redman
					<li>Oceans by Hillsong United</li>
					<li>Firm Foundation by John Chisum</li>
					<li>I have decided to follow Jesus</li>
					<li>Lord I Lift Your Name On High by MercyMe</li>
					<li>Lord Reign In Me by Brenton Brown</li>
					<li>The Lord’s My Shepherd by Stuart Townend</li>
					<li>Bless the Lord, my soul (Taizé).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Acolytes arrive in the church in time. They may need a preparation session beforehand.</p>
                <otlet>
                    <p>The role of the acolytes is to make the Holy Mass even more beautiful. They serve as angels around the altar. (It is better to have less acolytes but everyone should arrive on time. The only thing they can do wrong is be late and panic).</p>
                    <p>If there are enough acolytes, do not hesitate to use as many symbols as possible. Burning incense, lighting candles and cross bearing are not just old-fashioned accessories. They elevate the spirit as they affect all the senses by their scents, sounds and beauty.</p>
                </otlet>
                <p>Let the lectors read their texts beforehand.</p>
                <otlet>
                    <p>Make sure everyone can hear and understand the Bible readings very clearly. Therefore let senior students or grown ups read them. They set a good example for the younger students by serving at the altar.</p>
                </otlet>
            </div>

            <h2 id="title_2-4-2"><span class="number">4.2.</span>ARRIVAL AT THE MASS</h2>
            <div>
                <p>The groups arrive on time, bringing their creations to the church. The creations will be arranged together into one complex symbol.</p>
                <otlet>
                    <p>There will always be some groups who can’t make it on time to the church, either because they did not finish the discussion or just simply missed the time. Let us not worry about that at this point. Even if you have to start the Mass 15 minutes later, it is OK.</p>
                </otlet>
                <p>Some helpers guide the groups as they are arranging their symbols. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Place the milestones along the road leading up to the church or by the sides of the aisle from the entrance to the altar.</li>
					<li>Fix the signposts to the pews or benches.</li>
					<li>Place the footprints on the floor along the aisle from the entrance to the altar.</li>
					<li>The youngest students hold on to their bags and wait until everybody arrives.</li>
                </ul>
                <otlet>
                    <p>The individual symbols created by the groups will come together and form one complex symbol, a sign that can guide us.</p>
                    <p>Arranging and fixing the symbols always takes longer than planned. Appoint helpers for this task. It is a good opportunity for staff members who have not been involved in the spiritual parts of the program to feel included.</p>
                    <p>A large mass of children entering the church is always noisy. Let us accept it patiently and think of the little ones running up to Jesus | Mk 10:14. We can spend this time singing.</p>
                    <p>The arrival and the placing of the symbols should be impactful. The groups bring their creations to the church door one by one. Let the groups with the milestones arrive first and enter the church. If they put the milestones inside the church where everyone can see them, the priest may refer to them during the sermon.</p>
                </otlet>

                <div>
                    <p>The Mass itself starts at the entrance of the church. After greeting the congregation, the priest blesses the milestones, the signposts, the satchels, and the footprints. Then sprinkling holy water he proceeds to the sanctuary with his ministers. The liturgy of the Mass continues with the prayer and the readings. We do not sing the ‘Lord have mercy’ unless the celebrant priest insisted on it while planning the liturgy.</p>

                    <div class="card">

                        <p>Almighty and everlasting God, who shows us what is valuable and which way we have to go, bless these signposts to show us the right direction, and lead us closer to you! Amen.</p>
                        <p>Almighty and everlasting God, you are with us even in the hardest times, bless these footprints, enable us to follow the examples of those who have been there for us. Let us be able to carry and support each other, thus getting closer to you! Amen.</p>
                        <p>Almighty and everlasting God, you have shown yourself in world history many times, and you have appeared in our lives too, bless these milestones, whenever we return to them let us have faith and strength through them so that we may continue our journey with you toward life eternal. Amen.</p>
                        <p>Almighty God, you never let us travel with empty hands and empty hearts. Bless these satchels, and their contents so that all we have and make will glorify you alone and help us closer to you, through your Only Son, Jesus Christ! Amen.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Bring the offerings in a procession.</p>
                    <otlet>
                        <p>In most retreats this is the best time for the groups to bring their creations/ symbols to the altar.</p>
                        <p>Have a rehearsal of the procession and the placing of the symbols with the group leaders and the helpers before Mass. It seems to be a simple task, but some of the participants may be too anxious. A short rehearsal before Mass - even if it causes a few minutes of delay - will help everyone stay calm and maintain the solemn beauty of the liturgy.</p>

                <h3 id="title_2-4-3-6"><span class="number">4.9.</span>THE LORD’S PRAYER</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>If you want to avoid spending too much time on the sign of peace when children start greeting each other and chattering, you can substitute the sign of peace with a song. This way the children will remain more focused and will be able to pray the Agnus Dei.</p>

                <h3 id="title_2-4-3-7"><span class="number">4.10.</span>CONCLUDING RITES</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>After the prayer following Holy Communion, we can close the event with announcements and thanking the people who have contributed to the retreat.</p>
                    <p>The priest may give a longer, solemn blessing at the end.<br/>(Roman Missal, Solemn Blessings for Feast Days)</p>
                    <p>A procession of the assistance leaving the church is a beautiful way to conclude the Mass. The procession is led by the crossbearer, followed by the two candle bearers, here the group leaders may join, and then the acolytes and the rest of the assistance, concelebrant priests and the main celebrant.</p>
                    <otlet>
                        <p>This is a good way to keep group leaders together. They can immediately proceed to the evaluation session.</p>
                        <p>Take the symbols back to school with you, where you can display them in a public spot for a while as reminders of the retreat.</p>

        <h1 id="title_2-6"><span class="number">5.</span> EVALUATION ROUND — RIGHT AFTER HOLY MASS<ido> AT LEAST 30 MINUTES</ido>
        </h1>
        <div>
            <otlet>
                <p>The function of the evaluation is not just to gather feedback about the group activities and see how they affected the participants. The most important goal is that our group leaders - both students and colleagues - are given an opportunity to talk over what had happened during this day of hard work and anxiety. By sharing their experiences they receive confirmation and release tension.</p>
                <p>There will always be some groups that do not work as well as others. Group leaders usually blame themselves for it. Occasionally some groups can be challenging even for the most experienced group leaders, for example, when the participants lack openness. The group leaders are still learning, therefore our support is essential for them: we have to reassure them that the main responsibility is not theirs, having tried their best is enough. Success depends on the group members. God is able to move the members of a difficult group too. We must give all the motivation to the group leaders after such cases.</p>
            </otlet>
            <p>Group leaders, please go to the meeting point to share experiences immediately (!) after the Holy Mass. Bring along all the remaining accessories.</p>
            <otlet>
                <p>There seem to be several obstacles for people to join the evaluation session. However, make sure all group leaders (both students and teachers) come together after the retreat. It is especially useful that teachers and students evaluate the day together.</p>
                <p>Sit in a circle if possible so that people can see one another.</p>
                <p>Open the meeting by thanking everyone for their service. Emphasize your appreciation for their effort and dedication.</p>
            </otlet>
            <p>Ask the group leaders to answer the questions below one by one.</p>
            <otlet>
                <p>There will be only one round because some people may be in a hurry and would not be able to stay for a second round. If someone mentions only practicalities, ask them to talk about their emotions.</p>
            </otlet>
            <ul>
                <li>What was it like for you? What did it feel like to be a group leader?</li>
            </ul>
            <otlet>
                <p>These are two separate questions: We want to know about their feelings, not just about their work. We also want to hear how they see themselves in the role of a group leader.</p>
            </otlet>
            <ul>
                <li>Did anything important happen in the group? What was it?</li>
            </ul>
            <otlet>
                <p>The most important thing is that they can verbalize their joys and sorrows. These personal questions help them.</p>
                <p>If there is not enough time for everyone to give feedback, you can ask the participants to say only one word, and write down the detailed answers on a piece of paper. Anything is better than postponing the evaluation session or sending out a digital questionnaire.</p>
            </otlet>
            <p>There is something more.</p>
            <otlet>
                <p>There is more than one way of expressing our gratitude to the group leaders. The first is to make them feel that we believe in them and entrust the groups to them. We also have to verbalize our gratitude for their work. The third way to thank them is to reward their work with a bar of chocolate or a small gift. These are important gestures.</p>
