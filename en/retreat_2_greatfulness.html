  <title>RETREAT #2 — GRATEFULNESS</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1 id="title_3-1"><span class="number">1.</span>INTRODUCTION</h1>
  <div>
    <p>We organized this retreat in the JEZSU in 2016 Advent, with 600 students. The description below can be handed out to the group leaders as is.<p>
    <p>The foundation of our Christian life is gratefulness for the love of God. We are not motivated by the fear of punishment but by gratitude. If we can rekindle the gratitude in our hearts for the small and great things we received from God, through one another, our hearts will open. We are seeking gratitude and its root, God in this retreat with the help of a short parable.</p>

    </h2>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>Every class meets in their own classroom. The group leaders are still with their own class, they will join their group later, after receiving the mid-morning snacks.</li>
        <li>The children get their snacks now but will eat later.</li>
        <li>Group leaders leave their class and go to the classroom where their groups are.</li>
        <li>The group leaders take their groups to the location of the starting activity.</li>
      </ul>
      <otlet><p>It is important to choose a location for the starting activity where there is enough space for everyone, with good visibility and acoustics for the starting input. The starting activity is only 20 minutes long, therefore we can start the retreat in the school yard even in cold weather. A good sound system is essential. We will need at least 2 microphones.</p></otlet>
    </div>

    <h2 id="title_3-2-2"><span class="number">2.2.</span>STARTING SCENE — WE HAVE RECEIVED SO MUCH ALREADY! <ido>30 MINUTES</ido>
    </h2>
    <div>
      <p><strong>Singing</strong> We can start with a song to help everybody arrive, calm down and focus.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended songs:</strong> In the Lord I’ll Be Ever Thankful (Taize) or Blessed Be Your Name (Matt Redman).</p>
      <otlet><p>Singing together or learning a new song is a much more efficient tool of silencing a larger group of lively children than trying to shoo them. However, here the help of adults standing among the children is necessary.</p></otlet>

      <p><strong>Greeting</strong> We greet the participants. The greeting must be simple and very short, e.g.: <quote>Good morning, everybody. Let us start our retreat. Our theme today is gratitude. What does it
mean to us? Let us watch the first skit. </quote></p>

      <p><strong>The skit </strong> Students perform the first skit.</p>

      <otlet><p>Two students with good reading skills read out the conversation, while two others act out the story in a pantomime with slightly exaggerated gestures.</p></otlet>

          <footer>Harland Howard’s song No Charge was published in 1974, sung by Tina & Mom my (Tina Byrd And Mommy Tammy Wynette). The story is based upon this song. (sources: <a

      </h2>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Thought morsels</strong>: Children are gifts to their parents, group leaders are gifts to the participants, you are all gifts to one another. Let us rejoice in each other.</p>
        <p><strong>We are gifts</strong>: The leader of the opening activity asks the whole student body to turn away and look for the surprise in another direction. <quote>Please turn around and look that way. There is a surprise for you!</quote></p>
        <ul>
          <li>While everybody is looking the other way trying to catch sight of the surprise, the group leaders quickly gather in a bunch, cover themselves with white sheets and place a large red (previously tied) ribbon on top of the rather clumsy looking parcel.</li>
          <li>When the parcel is ready, the leader announces, <quote>Everybody can turn now! This is a gift just for you. Please take it with kindness!</quote></li>
          <li>When he utters the last words, the group leaders jump out of the parcel yelling and laughing and find their groups. As soon as everyone has calmed down again, the leader says the following:</li>
          <li><quote>You can all decide to be gifts for one another. Actually you already are. Often we do not even notice how many people are gifts in our lives. Also, there are some who do not love us too much, at least we do not feel that they love us. But even such people are gifts, and enrich our lives in many ways.</quote>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Announcements for the journey</strong>: the schedule for the retreat, what happens next, and when to come again to meet in this location.</p>
       <p><quote>„ Go and spend some time thinking and talking about if it is true that we are all gifts for one another. </quote></p>

  <h1 id="title_3-3"><span class="number">3.</span>GROUP ACTIVITIES <ido>2,5 HOURS</ido><br>
    <cimkieg>With snack break</cimkieg>
  </h1>
  <div>
    <p>The heart and soul of a retreat is the small group activity. Prepare the location beforehand so that it is welcoming and comfortable. Place chairs, cushions or blankets in a circle, put a candle in the middle, play pleasant music.</p>

    <h2 id="title_3-3-1"><span class="number">3.1.</span>INTRODUCTORY ROUND</h2>
    <div>
      <p>To have a meaningful and beautiful time with the group, the participants need to be able to listen to God and one another. Therefore:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Arrange the room beforehand. (seats in a circle, candle, music etc.). make the space pretty and welcoming.</li>
        <li>KGreet the group. Introduce yourself with a few words. It can be part of the starting game.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="title_3-3-2"><span class="number">3.2.</span>WARM-UP OR ICEBREAKER</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Icebreakers or introduction games help us arrive. We move around, meet one another, and eventually quieten down. It is time well spent. We can spend as long as 30 minutes here.</p>
      <p>The games listed here are only suggestions. Choose the ones you enjoyed the most during the preparatory sessions.</p>

      <tanacs><p>It is not a problem if some of them already know the game. They can play it again. </p>
        <p>When you return after a break, start with a game that helps the group calm down (make sure this game is not too lively).</p></tanacs>

    <h2 id="title_3-3-3"><span class="number">3.3.</span>MEDITATIVE EXERCISES<br><cimkieg>This part must not be omitted, especially with older children!</cimkieg>
    </h2>
    <div>
      <p><strong>Preparation</strong>: distribute the slips of paper and everyone has to have a pen or pencil. They can place them on the floor next to their seats.</p>

      <h4 id="title_3-3-3-1">BODY SENSING — RELAXATION AND MEDITATION</h4>
      <div>
        <p>This exercise helps get in the mood before dealing with serious topics.</p>
        <p>The group leader says the following: <quote>Sit down comfortably… close your eyes… focus on what you are sensing in your body at this moment… What does the shoe feel like for your feet? What do you feel?… It is good we have feet… Feel the trousers or skirt on your legs… are your legs relaxed? Or tingling? It is good to have legs to take us to places… You are sitting on the chair. Is it hard or soft? It is good to have a body that can sit… </quote></p>
        <p>Continue in this manner: back, shoulders, arms, palms, neck, jaw, head…</p>
        <p>When we have completed all the body parts the leader says: <quote>Thank you Lord that we are here. Thank you for life and thank you that we can move. Amen.</quote></p>
      </div>

      <h4 id="title_3-3-3-2">I AM A GIFT</h4>
      <div>
        <p>Group leader: <quote>Keep your eyes closed and as you are listening, try to savour these sentences in your mind.</quote> </p>
          <p>Read the sentences one by one:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I am a gift in the eyes of God | 30 seconds silence</li>
          <li>This is why God rejoices in me | 60 seconds silence</li>
          <li>I have a purpose, namely to bring happiness to someone | 60 seconds silence</li>
          <li>Life would be less without me | 60 seconds silence</li>
          <li>Because I bring colours in life | 60 seconds silence</li>
        </ul>
        <tanacs><p>Silence makes you sense time differently, 60 seconds may seem much longer. Do not hesitate to use a timer to make sure there is enough time between the sentences. The goal is that everyone can receive the message.</p></tanacs>
      </div>

      <h4 id="title_3-3-3-3">MEDITATING ON THE THREE LISTS OF GIFTS — WRITING ACTIVITY</h4>
      <div>
        <tanacs><p>For younger children drawing may work better. See description <a href="#title_3-3-5-3">below</a>.</p></tanacs>
        <p>The participants stay in silence while they take their pens and papers. </p>
        <p>Group leader: <quote>I am going to read a few questions. Please think about them, and write down your answers. It is just for yourself, you will not have to show it to anyone.</quote></p>
        <p>Wait 2 minutes between the questions to allow enough time for the participants to write down their answers.</p>


        <p><strong>You are a gift:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Write down the names of people who are happy that you are. These can also be people for whom you did something good.</li>
          <li>List your inner qualities that can be gifts for others or yourself.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>You receive gifts:</strong></p>
        <p>When did you feel that you were given a gift? Write three columns:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>First column: The gifts you got at home, in your family, among your relatives.</li>
          <li>Second column: in your various communities outside the school: scouting, choir, sports club. When did you feel that you received something beautiful, positive, something that gave you strength and hope?</li>
          <li>Third column: What did you receive at school, in your class, during lessons, in the breaks? List all the kindness, friendship, encouragement and actual presents you received, for which you are grateful.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Gifts we take for granted:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>What are the gifts that are so natural that you hardly notice, although you ought to be grateful for them? Try to think of at least five. List things that may not cause great joy at the time, but actually gifts of great value.</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2 id="title_3-3-4"><span class="number">3.4.</span>SHARING</h2>
    <div>
      <p>The point of sharing is that the participants can express what happened in their souls during the meditative part earlier. The words they speak out will cleanse their emotions, and they will help each other by sharing their own struggles and joys. The group leaders must make sure that everybody has a chance to speak, and they have to encourage and help the quieter children as well.</p>
      <tanacs><p>A good sharing can make or break the whole retreat. If the group can go deep in the topic, it is well worth the time.</p>
     <p>It may be helpful to start with a short question and answer session, going in a circle, and later the group can have an unstructured discussion. Make sure they do not go astray from the topic, and that everybody has a chance to speak.</p></tanacs>
      <p>A beszélgetést segíthetik a következő kérdések:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Short questions that can be helpful to the I AM A GIFT - meditation.</li>
        <li>What were your feelings when you were thinking about being a gift?</li>
        <li>Which sentence was the easiest, and which was the hardest for you? (You can list the five statements from that exercise.) </li>
        <li>Give an example of one of these statements being true in your own life.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="title_3-3-4-1">MEDITATING ON THE THREE LISTS OF GIFTS — Writing activity</h4>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>Did you have enough time for filling the three comuns? Did you need more time? How many names did you write?</li>
          <li>For more advanced groups: Could you share an inner quality of yours that makes you a gift to others? Which column was the most difficult? Which was the easiest for you to fill in when you had to list the gifts you received? Which column was the longest?</li>
          <li>Have you found gifts that you have been taking for granted despite them being really valuable? Share an example that the others have not mentioned yet.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <tanacs><p>You do not have to use all these helping questions. As soon as the group engages in a serious discussion about being a gift or receiving gifts, about gratefulness, let them continue the discussion as long as possible.</p></tanacs>
    </div>

    <h2 id="title_3-3-5"><span class="number">3.5.</span>ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES <br><cimkieg> Choose from these games if you think they help the group.</cimkieg>
    </h2>
    <div>
      <p>It may happen that a group is not able to continue the discussion very long or the discussion stays quite superficial. In such cases we can choose from the activities below to help the participants enter into a more profound way of thinking.</p>

      <tanacs><p>Let us read and try out these activities during the preparation period to make sure we have something to go to if the group needs it.</p></tanacs>

        <div class="card">

          </h4>
          <div>
            <p>Everyone writes 5 gifts that are important for him or her, on 5 separate pieces of paper (the size of a playing card or a bank card). We put all the cards in one pile and shuffle them.</p>
            <p>We choose one group member, for whom everybody else has to select and hand a gift card from the pile and explain why he would give this to him or her. (because this suits her personality, or it is important for her etc.)</p>
            <p>When this round is finished, we put back all the gift cards on the pile, shuffle them, and choose the next person. We continue until everyone has received their cards and explanations. — #8</p>

          <div>
          <p>We then may continue either of two ways:</p>

             <li>Everybody reads their own description to the group and the others comment on it. It is an interesting situation for all; a very strong self awareness and self-articulation experience for the reader, (it can be quite a surprise for the others), while the group can give feedback, express their agreement, surprise, disbelief, that may be interesting for the reader. If the reader or the group feels the description is too general, the group may complement it, which may be beneficial for all. </li>
             <li> The group leader picks a description from a hat, reads it aloud, and the group tries to guess who wrote it. The group members may add to the description. The objective of this activity is that everyone feels their own uniqueness, since there are no two identical descriptions.</li>

          </h4>
          <div>
            <p>We can use this game instead of the <a href="#title_3-3-3-3">MEDITATING ON THREE LISTS OF GIFTS</a>.</p>

            <p>Divide the participants into the smallest groups possible. Every group will decide what the most important/most beautiful gifts are at home, at school, in the class, in other communities, in the afternoons etc. Then every group will present the gift they decided on in a still image or as if they were a group of sculptures. They may express emotions vocally but not with words.</p>

            <p>The other participants have to guess what gift they are trying to represent. After each successful guessing the group can explain why it was the most important for them.</p>

          </h4>
          <div>
            <p>Instead of writing down the <a href="#title_3-3-3-3">MEDITATING ON THREE LISTS OF GIFTS</a> -, the points may be represented with simple drawings. The title of the first picture will be: “I am a gift for others”. Allow enough time for the children to draw, and encourage them to make it as detailed as possible. Then everyone shows their picture and the group can talk about it. (Agree with the children that nobody is using judgemental words like ‘ugly’, ‘lame’, ‘quite pretty’ or similar, but encourage them to pay attention to the contents.</p>
            <p>The next picture may be called “Everything I got from my family”. You may give several titles, and everyone can choose what they find most inspiring. Again, help them to draw details, and discuss the pictures. </p>
            <p>The third picture is called “I am a gift in the eyes of God, and He rejoices in me”. Do not be afraid to give such a title, the children will know what to draw.</p>

          </h4>
          <div>
            <p>The group members will act out an ordinary day. The goal is that they realize how many people they meet whom they can be grateful to. You can write these people on post-it notes and stick them on the wall for all to see.</p>
            <p>For example the group leader asks ‘How do you come to school?’ Someone says, ‘by bus’. Then ask this child to act out as he is taking the bus, and say, ‘Do you meet anyone in the bus?’ Then someone may remember the bus driver, whom we can be thankful for driving us to school. Then someone can pantomime the bus driver for a few seconds, and you can write “bus driver ” on a post-it, and someone can stick it on the wall. Then you can ask the next question. “Have you met anyone at the gate in the morning?” and so on. We do not need to force them to always find someone to thank, but encourage them and prompt them with helpful questions. It will be a heartwarming feeling to look at the collection of names on the wall at the end.</p>

      <p><quote> We are going to collect the most important gifts we have received. We are writing them all on a cash register tape or bill. This cash register tape will be similar to the bill <a href="#title_3-2-2-1">in the first story</a>: we have many many things we have received and were paid for a long time ago</quote></p>
      <p>Make a long dtrip of paper stapling 3 sheets of A4 paper together at the short ends.</p>
      <p>Write a list of gifts you have received on it.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You may use different colours for family, school, community, my body, from God etc.</li>
        <li>You may draw pictures next to each item.</li>
        <li>You may allocate a value to each item representing the importance of it. For example every group member has three stars, and can mark the gifts that are the most important for him, by sticking one or more stars next to them.</li>

Place the cash register tape in the centre next to the candle and the cross. As you are preparing the room, try to be quiet to prepare your souls.</p>

        <li>Make the sign of the cross and sing a song (e. g.: Laudate omnes gentes by Taizé - in your own language).</li>

    <otlet><p>If there is no Holy Mass at the end, the groups gather in an appropriate place to close the event. There will be final thoughts and a blessing. If there is a Holy Mass at the end, these can be inserted after the entrance procession or after the sermon.</p></otlet>
    <p><strong>The groups staple or tape</strong> their cash register tapes together at the end. The end result is a very very long gratitude tape.</p>
    <otlet><p>Staplers are the most efficient tools for this, because it takes quite a long time otherwise. Several people may need to help.</p>
      <p>Place the long (1 metre per group) tape to a place where it is visible to all: lie it in the church between the isles, or let it hang from the third floor in the school assembly hall. It is important not to roll it up, but let everyone be amazed at its length.</p></otlet>
    <p><strong>Sing together, learn a new song</strong> while we are waiting for the groups to arrive and staple their tape to the common tape.</p>
    <otlet><p>No matter how well you organize the retreat, there will be groups who come a bit late. The best is to sing while we are waiting for them.</p></otlet>

    <div>
        <p><quote><strong>Look</strong> how long our cash register tape is! There are so many things that we are grateful for, that we have received from God. We received all these not because we somehow managed to be good, - of course we try usually, - neither, because we deserve them. We were given all these gifts because God loves us and he is happy to give them to us.</quote></p>
        <p><quote><strong>Remember</strong> what you have written on this tape! And have a look at what others have written. You can even take a photo with your phone. Remember every gift listed here, so that you can remember them in hard times. And when you have good times, you can add more items to this list.</quote></p>
        <p><quote><strong>Pass on to others</strong> what you have received. Make it real. In the next three days show your gratitude to someone in a concrete way. This person can be your friend, teacher, family member or an “enemy”. Express your gratitude in a very concrete way, with both words and deeds.</quote></p>
